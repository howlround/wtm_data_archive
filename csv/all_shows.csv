Will his equally harried co-workers (Anne Louise Brings, Joe Crnich, April Fossen, Sarah Danielle Young) join him in his protest or will they talk him back onto the sales floor? Directed by Jerry Rapier.

Asun, an American Latina in an Abercrombie world, breaks off her wedding engagement because the question wasn’t popped the way she always dreamed – only to be slapped with the dark truth of her loneliness and regret. An emotional rollercoaster that electrifies and torments, Your Problem With Men dissects the contemporary woman’s expectations in a culture clinging to last century’s visions of love and marriage.",,,

But in life outside the ballpark, that dedication can be harder to hold on to. Lauren is thinking only about the monumentally important playoff game she and her mother are about to attend, but her mother has her own agenda. In this touching play, set against the dual backdrops of the 2003 and 1906 Chicago Cub teams, three die-hard fans and one die-hard player reveal the redeeming power of baseball.

In Evelyn's desperate attempt to make sense of her life she grasps at the impossible: halting the inevitable ticking clock. But the cost of this seeming impossibility may be destroying the family she has worked a lifetime to create. Fantasy and memory collide in this family drama that examines questions central to the human experience. What does it mean to die? And when you do, what is the legacy that you want to leave behind?

We meet a group of teenagers whose fathers are being released from prison after serving time for the mass killings of their Tutsi neighbors. How will these innocents — young people who don’t even remember their fathers — live with this brutal legacy? Can they go beyond it, or will they be shaped by their tragic heritage? Castillo’s production of Children of Killers, directed by Emily Mendelsohn, comes on the heels of Katori Hall’s Broadway triumph last season, with her Olivier-Award-winning play The Mountaintop.",,,

Meanwhile, his estranged daughter, Gessica, now a mother, is slowly realizing that even a willing convert to Catholicism is not free from suspicion -- suspicions that may affect even her daughter's prospects. The merchant prince, Antonio, over-extended with his Christian creditors and unable to borrow from Jewish lenders, hatches a plan with his legal advisor, Portia, and Gessica's husband, Lorenzo, to seize the remains of Shylock's fortune in order to finance a new trade venture.

Having learned long ago that Antonio is not a man to be trusted and that Venice is not a city predisposed to give him justice, Shylock has been planning to escape so that he might live his last years in peace. Meanwhile, Gessica is drawn into the commercial conflict between her husband's friends and her father, and a bombastic Spanish ship captain in Antonio's employ seems willing to cut a deal with both sides.

His complex characters seek to take control over written destinies, to act on their lives without succumbing to the weight of the past, or the constraints imposed by society.

Tree and girl forge a unique bond that leads the girl on a life-long quest to protect the rainforest, while awakening a new consciousness in the tree. This production is the play’s premiere.

The Tree Play is inspired by real events from contemporary history. It is informed by the assassinations and threats to environmental activists who (still) lay down their lives defending the Amazon rainforest against industrial-scale clearing and the entrenched forces behind deforestation. The play uses the story of one girl and one tree to make the point that the stakes are extraordinarily high in the struggle to preserve the vital forests of the Earth. 

The production makes innovative use of space, creating an immersive environment inside the theatre. Audiences are guided into the rainforest where they sit among the trees, up close to the action, under the jungle canopy.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA – August 1, 2012 – Thirteen teams are producing plays around the nation as participants in playwright Erik Ehn’s “Soulographie,” an ambitious international collaboration to produce his 17-play cycle on genocide. Following local productions, the full cycle will be presented in a two-week commemorative event at La Mama in New York City in November 2012. In the Bay Area, director Rebecca Novick will collaborate with noted choreographer Erika Chong Shuch on Dogsbody, the sixteenth play in the cycle, which will be performed at Intersection for the Arts, September 21-23.
Soulographie in the Bay Area

Dogsbody, the 16th play in the cycle, deepens the inquiry into the hearts of perpetrators by looking at war through the eyes of child soldiers as they grow up. Part One tells the stories of four children abducted into the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda in the haunting words of their parents, Part Two imagines a future forever war in Texas, asking us to imagine what it would be like if American children were involved in such a conflict. Director Rebecca Novick has been a long-time collaborator of Ehn’s. Her world premiere of Ehn’s ‘Maid’ (Crowded Fire, 2003) was one of the company’s most well-received shows and she commissioned and developed Burnt Umber (another piece in the Soulographie cycle) while serving as Crowded Fire’s artistic director.

Ehn’s decade-long project asks us to undertake a “revolution of the heart” and calls for a performance context that reaches for understanding and healing. In this spirit, the process — and ultimately the performance experience that the Dogsbody artists are building towards — will invite a variety of participants to share stories, witness others’ stories, and come together to travel deeply into the dark heart of this material, emerging hopefully with a shared sense of the healing. Ehn often says that the audience he imagines for this work would bring together “scholars, sages, and survivors.” Organized around this aim, the three performance days at Intersection will each begin with a pre-show dialogue followed by a potluck dinner and then the performance. Collaborators on this special programming include the Playwrights Foundation, USF’s Department of Performing Arts and Social Justice, Eritrean Youth for Change, Priority Africa Network, and others.

About Soulographie:

For fifteen years, noted playwright Erik Ehn has been visiting the locations of genocides — collecting testimony, sharing evidence with students, and collaborating with local residents to explore how the performing arts can aid recovery. Encountering the extraordinary and horrific accumulation of testimony that has emerged from late 20th Century genocides, Erik felt an obligation as an artist to tell some of these stories and a compelling need to examine, through the lens of drama, how a society makes its way to atrocity. How, he wondered, can we tell the story of such a collective abdication of empathy without participating in it ourselves? How can we bear witness appropriately and how can this witnessing help heal? Featuring Ehn’s signature blend of poetry, image, vision and humor, the plays of the Soulographie cycle take us from the Tulsa Race Riots to El Salvador, from Bosnia to Rwanda and the child armies of East Africa. In each case, the plays weave together international incidents with their domestic implications and global atrocity with the parallel disaster of the erosion of the human heart. Technology is haunted, landscape is sacred, and language is the way we are both broken and healed in this extraordinary effort by one of our most visionary playwrights. Currently the Head of Playwriting at Brown University, Ehn is a leading American playwright whose work has been produced around the world.

Synopsis. Aglaonike, the first female astronomer, could predict lunar eclipses, but her science was suspect because she was a woman. She therefore billed herself as a sorceress and claimed she could draw down the moon. Inspired by her unsung history, this coming-of-age play follows the protagonist through a series of challenges, both magical and scientific.

How did self-entitlement and lack of empathy for one another become normal? At what point did it become acceptable—even sexy—to sing about sexual violence, to laugh at jokes about rape?

Blurred Lines is a performance and a conversation, one that draws attention to the profound impact of rape in our society and challenges audiences to reflect on the roles we all play in a culture that promotes silence and blurs the lines of consent.

By taking the shame out of talking about sex and sexual assault, Blurred Lines inspires healing through storytelling and empowers a new generation of leaders to end cycles of sexual violence, from inside the home to college campuses and beyond.

NJwodhJgME5aQnAHh,Alexander Zeldovich and AES+F's Psychosis,"[{'_id': '5877b4b917334f313edb4816', 'name': 'Sarah Kane'}]","Sarah Kane’s *4.48 Psychosis* is one of the key plays in the generation of Britain’s “in-yer-face” drama. The texts of Sarah Kane (1971 - 1999) employed shock, pain and the evocation of a sense of disgust and discomfort in the spectator in order to break down the ever-resistant fourth wall separating audiences from what happens on stage. 

Nineteen actress of various ages are cast in this production. They form a choir of inner voices that run the gamut of intonations from irony to hysteria, from malaise or depression to lyricism, sarcasm, farce and grotesque. 

Joining director Alexander Zeldovich in an exploration of the limits of female experience are the designers from the AES+F group. Their input makes them full-fledged co-creators of this show.

AES+F’s video material (animated 3D graphics) runs parallel to the text, occasionally matching it in an associative way, occasionally losing touch entirely in a surrealistic way. The poetics of the video content, sometimes fairy-tale like, sometimes horror-like, is filled with images of the archetypal female body - blood, milk, black snow, psychedelic colors and insects.
“This production is a dance macabre, a dance of death, a ritual and a grotesque,” says director Alexander Zeldovich. “The tragic is always the slash where destiny is the numerator, the individual is the denominator, and the remainder of each depends on their faith.”

Even the cod-Norwegian accents are miniaturized; like the accents in Disney’s “It’s A Small World”. Nothing here is real except the pain. Both Torvald and Nora are trapped in a meta-narrative, playing out an illusion of male power. Both pay the price: the death of love.

Meanwhile the audience knows that their daughter, like many others, has become a victim of the Belgian child abuser and murderer Marc Dutroux, the man who was revealed in the mid-Nineties to have kidnapped, sexually abused and killed children over a period of many years. And who remained undiscovered for a bafflingly long time. 
Milo Rau, whose numerous productions have made him one of the most talked-about directors and provocateurs on the political theater scene, has all the parts played by children aged between 8 and 13 from the CAMPO Theater, Ghent. In doing so he inverts hierarchies. The potential victims actively lay claim to the widest range of roles in this drama. Yet at the same time Rau makes no secret of the fact that this reversal is not so easy to achieve. His stage is anything other than a non-hierarchical space: the one remaining adult gives directions and switches between director, casting director, Dutroux and a father figure, both friendly and creepy at the same time. In ‘Five Easy Pieces’ – five simple experiments with nothing easy about them – the spotlight is on those who usually remain in the background of the news reports. ",[],,

The record, filled with messages from world leaders, greetings in many languages, pictures and sounds from earth, and a sampling of our music, was launched aboard the Voyager space probes on their interstellar reconnaissance mission, which continues to this day.

In an evening that travels through time and space, A Host of People will evoke the original team’s story, while creating a new one--asking the audience to imagine what it is to communicate our vast, yet puny, existence to aliens and to ourselves. Through artifacts from the original record, video transmissions, imagistic journeys, poetry and interviews, strange dances and original music, each performance will re-release a new Golden Record for that specific night, in that particular place, with the humans in that room. As with all A Host of People shows, a party will unfold, celebrating both life here and the possible lives out there in this vast and awesome universe.","['Contemporary', 'Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'New Work', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['United States'],['English']

Euripides’s tragedy *The Bacchae* is the third part of his last tetralogy. It was written in 406 BC just before his death and has remained a masterpiece of world literature and theatre ever since. It is the story of the god Dionysus who turns earthly women into bacchantes, wild creatures he uses to exact revenge. It is interwoven with motifs, which together and separately are found in dramatic art, right to the present: the clash of civilization and chaos, of reason and madness, of nature and culture.Russian readers and audiences are in a privileged position thanks to this translation by Innokenty Annensky: it is not only the work of a great poet, but also of a thinker who considers Euripides to be perhaps the most important author of the past, and someone with whom he feels in constant dialogue. In his translation of *The Bacchae*, Annensky was not looking for the exact verbal equivalent in Russian. He translated more freely, recreating in a different lexical setting a symbiosis of poetry, music and philosophy. It was this particular translation that Theodoros Terzopoulos chose to use for his production at the STANISLAVSKY Electrotheatre.","['Classical', 'International', 'Physical Theatre', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['Russia'],['Russian']

In the tradition of Peter Brook’s legendary Conference of the Birds (1982) and The Mahabharata (1988) the 2017 remount of The Secret River has been thrillingly reconceived for the stunning natural outdoor amphitheatre setting of the Anstey Hill quarry.","['Contemporary', 'Indigenous', 'International', 'Translations / Adaptations', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['Australia'],['English']

Lauren Demerath

February 23 - March 26, 2017

Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays at 7:30pm and Sundays at 3:00pm

The Den Theatre, 1333 N. Milwaukee Avenue

GENTLE is a world premiere adapted and directed by Founding Artistic Director Zeljko Djukic, based on the short story A Gentle Woman, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It follows a young immigrant woman, a pawnbroker, and their maid over the course of a short, mysterious marriage. Dostoevskys brilliant tale of the obsessive power of ego, and its ability to push ordinary people to extraordinary measures, is modernized by Djukic as a story of our times. Surprising and sharp-witted, GENTLE combines the Russian master storytellers ability to reveal extremes of human nature, with TUTAs characteristic sophistication and inventiveness.

Here, for instance, apparently easy-going social chit-chat can gradually become extreme and loaded with cynical black humour as hidden feelings unexpectedly burst out — often exposing each ventriloquist’s carefully disguised inner loneliness.

To create this unique conversational play with its cast comprising both puppets and ventriloquists, the French artist and renowned choreographer Gisèle VIENNE — who is well known for her puppet plays revealing humans’ darker sides — collaborated with the leading German puppet-theatre company Puppentheater Halle.

Together, they breathe such powerful life into the puppets that audiences at Shizuoka Arts Theatre should prepare to be shocked — and transported into another world. ",['Puppetry'],['Germany'],['English']

The production, inspired by the authors’ research trip to the world’s most isolated country – North Korea, questions the idea of freedom in the era of ever-intensifying global surveillance. The audience will have a chance to get a unique touristic tour through a country considered by the “Western World” to be the biggest bogeyman, whose existence raises the question on freedom and lack of freedom in today’s society. The show brings up many other issues as well: how extensive are the limits of our thinking, conditioned by constant propaganda and the context from which we came? How relative is the notion of freedom and in what way is it determined by the socio-cultural context? Is the visible cult of personality worse than the invisible cult of money? What does North Korea, the last remnant of the Cold War tell us about our “Western” world? Is having an atomic bomb and a nationwide defence concept the only way to avoid imperial dominance? Is a socialist political structure always totalitarian? The show faces the possibilities and impossibilities of talking about a country that resides outside our cultural and political code.",[],,"['English', 'Serbian']"

Depot Theatre Wayne Tunks BITCHExposing the raw, sinister and darkly funny underbelly of suburban Australian family life, Wayne Tunks’ latest play, BITCH will receive its premiere at the Depot Theatre from 2 June 2017.

BITCH is a stunningly contemporary tale with relatable characters and themes of alcohol, gambling and porn addiction, family trauma, racism, gender politics and more. And, through it all, heart-warming humour!

The Post family are the epitome of dysfunctional. Matriarch Julie is a casual racist with a drinking and pokie habit. Son Jimmy is still reeling from trauma as a teen and 25 years later is still a seething mess of anger and sadness. Sister Robyn works in fashion retail, but her manager, Fiona, is anything but supportive.

Robyn has 17-year-old twins, Emma is in love with douche Matt, while Clint may love his boyfriend Reid but suspects he may have been born the wrong gender. BITCH is a gritty drama, full of black comedy.

“These are characters that people will recognise – maybe as members of the family we see on special occasions and just shake our heads…” says Tunks. “I have been working on this particular play for years, adding new bit all the time, aiming to create an important story, but more than that, a realistic story.”

Tunks Productions is one of the leading producers of quality Australian independent theatre. Its hits include The Subtle Art of Flirting, We’ll Always Have Wagga, The Bridesmaid Must Die!, Silvertop Ash, Hell Hath No Fury and Everything I Know I Learnt From Madonna.

Last year was especially huge for Tunks, presenting Flame Trees, Fag Boy and the Married Guy and two seasons of The Girlie Show – packing them in at theatres around Australia. Wayne Tunks has been a storyliner on Neighbours and is currently the Festival Director of Short+Sweet Sydney.

A controversial new gaming experience is inspiring a generation.

In Killology, players are rewarded for torturing victims, scoring points for “creativity”.

Out on the streets, not everybody agrees with him.

“There is an instinctive revulsion against taking a human life. And that revulsion can be conquered.”

Through the creation of an innovative mobile, enclosed audience unit, the production investigates the close relationship between sensation, violence and entertainment in contemporary visual culture. Throughout the production, the audience unit moves through space like a rolling camera dolly and the audience views the performance through an aperture of changing dimensions, not unlike the lens of a camera. The framing of the aperture and movement of the audience unit creates intense sensory effects for the audience.

Acclaimed Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai blends the words of Rabin’s widow, Leah, with live music and projections as a theatrical counterpoint to his 2015 investigative film Rabin, the Last Day. Seated at either end of a table, two actresses (Einat Weizman and Sarah Adler) read from Leah’s memoirs. Together, they travel back through time to explore the violence that led to Rabin’s assassination, traumatizing a country and sending shockwaves around the world. Premiered at the Festival d’Avignon last summer and coming to the Ford directly from the acclaimed Lincoln Center Festival, the piece exists between elegy and lullaby, “reconstructing the past and renewing the conscience of humanity."" Inferno Magazine


In conjunction with this performance, the Ford has partnered with the Skirball Cultural Center to co-present a screening of Rabin, the Last Day, taking place at the Skirball on Thursday, July 20, at 8:00 p.m. In this political thriller, Amos Gitai documents the November 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Through staged re-enactments and archival news footage, Gitai illuminates the subculture of hate—fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue—that led to Rabin’s untimely death. This “never less than eerily absorbing” film, as lauded by the Independent, is a “must-see.”

Rabin, The Last Day at the Skirball is FREE for Yitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination ticket-holders. Ticket-holders will be able to request free screening tickets by selecting this event in the ""add-ons"" section of the shopping cart.

August 8 - 27, 2017

Directed by Ashlie Corcoran
Starring Paul Dunn & Mark Crawford

A sweet summer comedy about finding your community. When Brett inherits his aunt’s house, he and his partner move out of Toronto to set up a B&B in a quiet little tourist town. Great idea. It never crossed either of their minds that being a same-sex couple would raise eyebrows and generate friction. This comedy about “being out” in a small town is a tour-de-force for two actors: they play the central couple plus all the characters they encounter, from contractors to relatives to the lesbian who runs the coffee shop.

Directed by Michael Shamata
WORLD PREMIERE

A tender re-imagining of a life together. Forget About Tomorrow is a play about a family – a loving family in crisis. When Jane’s husband Tom begins having trouble with his memory, she goes into denial: “you’re over-tired”…“your anxiety is making it worse”…“the doctor doesn’t think it’s anything serious”… But it is. At age 50, Tom has early-onset Alzheimer’s. The play – at times extremely funny and always deeply moving – is Jane’s long and reluctant journey to accepting her husband’s fate, and the new role that she is expected to play.

A fantastic ensemble excels in breathtaking fighting scenes, deadly intrigues and heartbreaking arias of world-famous plays. Night by night they steer towards unprecedented triumphs. That is on one side. On the other side three stage technicians work in the backstages' darkness. Their lives, which usually remain hidden, now recede into the light. 
Familie Flöz has created a small family, whose home is the theatre itself: the efficient Bob is young, strong and unpredictable; the chronically tired and sickly Bernd is constantly bossed around and the idle, always hungry Ivan is permanently anxious not to loose control over the shows. 

Separated from the radiant stars on stage by nothing more than a sparse scenery the three untiring helpers are fighting for their own happiness in a different universe. Yet in a magical way the glamorous world of pretence connects and is blended with the down to earth life backstage. 
TEATRO DELUSIO is once again the art to say everything without a single word.

The son dreams of his great love while fighting his sister in his effort to gain control of the hotel. Meanwhile, the maid is in the habit of stealing the hotel guests' valuables, and the cook chops up much more than just pork...

To examine that, the authors create imaginary identities, Ms Fox and Ms Cat, who are joined by the mysterious Mr Eye on the piano.
They begin by questioning classic approaches to choreography, by dealing in an ironic way with Ravel’s Bolero, one of the ballet block-busters.
Diving deeper into the imagination and theatre as the space of magic, they perform with 100 miniature performer-statues, creating a vortex of shadowy performances.

In monologues, they deal with two different approaches to textuality on stage, using parts of Virginia Woolf’s last novel Between the Acts and Erica Fisher Lichte’s The Transformative Power of Performance. Identifying the performer as magician – entertainer, the authors use Macbeth Witches, but their magic dance is a classic Charleston. The end brings the performers back to their first identity – contemporary dance, and the dance improvisation, while the stage becomes a visually magical and wild place, drowned in dramatic and rich sound.

Kim Noble wants us to get closer—perhaps too close for comfort. After an existential crisis triggered by a colossal breakup, and by the profound loneliness he sees in his father at the end of his life, Noble is on a quest for connection. Using narration and guerrilla video, Noble takes the audience through a series of hilarious, and often excruciating, social experiments.

Diana, a Colombian-American, was initially drawn to Ana’s story because, as an actress, she was not finding female, much less Latina roles of interest and substance. The character of Ana Mendieta -- a Cuban refugee, a provocative artist who worked in her own blood, a brilliant woman tragically engaged in a marital dance of death -- inspired Diana’s imagination. Diana and Tom had always wanted a two-hander, something they could produce and perform themselves. The story of Ana and Carl fit the bill. Tom and Diana began writing the play, and brought in Chris as a director almost immediately to help shape the scenes. It soon became apparent that the play was being created seamlessly, almost devised, really, by the three collaborators. Silueta was a Playlab selection at the Great Plains Theater Conference, where it received a staged reading, and a finalist for the Ashland New Plays Festival (final round of 12). It also received a staged reading at the Chance Theater in Anaheim under a different title. 

Silueta is a two person play inspired by the true story of Ana Mendieta, a Cuban- American performance artist and sculptor, whose life ended in a harrowing 34-story fall from the SoHo apartment she shared with her husband, Minimalist sculptor, Carl Andre. Ana, 36 at the time of her death in 1985, was a rising star in the SoHo art scene, known for her signature ‘siluetas’ -- provocative impressions of her naked body in blood, earth, fire and and other manifestations of nature. Carl, already famous as a founding father of geometric, building-block Minimalism, was past the peak of his career. It was a marriage of opposing artistic temperaments, fueled by ferocious ego and ambition on the part of both. Due to the emotional violence of their relationship and Carl’s enigmatic behavior following Ana’s death, he was accused and tried for her murder. Although Carl was eventually acquitted, the incident polarized the art world and became a cause celebre for feminists, many of whom still believe in Carl’s guilt. Although there is much speculation about what actually happened that terrible night, only Carl, now an old man still living in that same 34-floor apartment, really knows. Or does he?

Our play, Silueta, imagines an elderly Carl desperate to recover artistic potency, but blocked by a past he is unwilling to remember and face. He is haunted by the passionately ‘real’ ghost of Ana, equally desperate to discover the truth of her death and, more importantly, the truth of her life and Carl’s love. ",[],,

In 2016 a completely new cast takes on the challenge of this world hit.

The fear of being possessed by something or someone also has its reverse side: the longing to change into something or someone else. Fear and desire circle around the same core. This desire to transform is the central theme of ‘In Spite of Wishing and Wanting’.

Two short stories, one by Julio Cortazar and one by Paul Bowles, have been haunting Wim Vandekeybus for a while now.

ALL IS LIFE

‘Let’s try to go beyond, leaning over the balcony of language.’

What else can be an alternative to plain reality than trying to grasp the soul of things?
Now, Miet Warlop stages real people with open minds that reach straight for the heart.
Five performers swing around major themes such as religion, martyrdom, slow-motion terrorism, romanticism, tradition, leadership, psychosis, time, drugs, trips and nature…
The piece begins with a movement of lights, colours, sounds and emotions reflected onto the audience.
Through the depths of darkness we perceive a man moving about with large steps. Unlike in Warlop’s earlier piece Mystery Magnet, where a stout guy absorbs everything, the focal point now is a roadie, a figure we know from rock concerts. He is a young muscle who connects things, amplifies them and plugs every item into the network on stage.
Still in the dark, we start singing about what terrifies us. Shaking ourselves loose from fears and desires, we nestle in the open arms that this performance can be.
‘I know that you know what we know. Embarrassing!’, we sing. And ‘Tell me, is this my world? Where do I belong?’.
Popular tunes and deep thoughts exorcise the issues we all have, shaking off the panic and anxieties that cloud our hearts.
Through songs, Fruits of Labor aims to create the space and momentum to breathe in unison with the audience.
After paint and plaster, in Fruits of Labor Miet Warlop now explores music and lyrics as material to build a performance.
And while her previous stage piece Dragging the Bone uses the aesthetics of art exhibitions, Fruits of Labor can be seen as a concert, a rolling revue of songs and dances, with at its core an awkwardly oversized white cube in constant transformation.",[],[],['English']

The tragedy made headlines and shocked the world all over. Meshack Mavuso and Aubrey Poo lead a strong cast of 30 artists that unleashes a blow by blow account of the events that led to the loss of 44 lives at the hands of the police and the miners. “Tomorrow morning, the men will sing again. Their spears, pangas, inculas and sticks will clatter menacingly. They will recite battle cries from their homelands, and move about in organised columns, raising clouds of dust. But 34 of them will sing for the very last time.” *MARIKANA - THE MUSICAL* gives faces and names to the fallen brothers, sons, fathers and uncles. Twenty years into our democracy, can we say that we are a tolerant society if we can lose so many lives at our own hands? 

The production uses new compositions by Mpho Mckenzi Matome & Zakhele Mabena and the traditional songs that were sung in unison and beautiful harmonies as the miners expressed their emotions, frustrations, poverties and miseries.

Sidekicks is a contemporary circus production that deals with the fate of being sidelined and ignored.

Sonja Jokiniemi's new performance is built around the concept of blabbing: the associative, potentially senseless, sometimes spontaneous, clumpy, not-knowing form of speech.

With this new work, Jokiniemi continues to explore the chaotic experience of the world and how meaning is established. The mind of the performance is built on a foundation of linguistic indefinability, senses, desires and reflexes; where the human is part of the non-human. Different bodies find each other as extensions, parallel connections and expansions. The essence of the work is shaped by the collaboration and relations between the elements.

Blab is a hybrid performance, a blend of painting, sculpture and choreography. It seeks to escape the world of categories and knowingness towards the unknown; towards unions of human and object, images and rituals of desire. The unknown manifests itself in the transforming sculpture, the essence of which charts the subconscious territory.",['Dance / Movement / Choreography'],['Finland'],

It is a southern language, trivial and popular, which the Sicilian director ennobled with metaphors and pushed to its limits within surrealist situations. Words, bodies, and rhythms which highlight, not without imagination, the brutality of the human comedy and which stand up to remind us of the social and political engagement of a community, whether a family or the community of the theatre. With Bestie di scena, Emma Dante continues her quest for honesty. No text, no set, no costumes, no music. But actors. Actors left to their own devices, actors up to the challenge. From backstage, objects, clothes, words come flying at them in unexpected ways. Forced to survive just as the group falls apart, they start transforming over and over again: into animals, children, idiots... For Emma Dante, who creates here a true poetic art in her quest for “the juice of drunkenness and torment,” actors are on the frontline of this attempt to break down the conventions of theatre. We are all those “imbeciles, without structure and without mask, facing the tragedies of the modern world.”",[],,

As Kylián will be turning 70 in 2017, we will make this production a celebration of his artistic career as well as a celebration of his birthday.

Jiří Kylián is one-of-a-kind and without a doubt one of the greatest choreographers of our time – a beacon in the international world of dance. He uses the abstract world of dance to explore the depths of the human soul. The steps and the dance flow between reality and imagination, brutality and beauty with a rare sensuality and originality.

Silk & Knife 2 consists of four ballets, which when performed together, give a broad insight into Kylián’s choreographic work. The four ballets are 27’52”, Falling Angels, Sarabande and Symphony of Psalms. 27’52” is a dark piece about the barbaric beauty of human entanglements, Falling Angels and Sarabande juxtapose each other as a tribute to the female and male dancer respectively, while Symphony of Psalms is both hypnotic and spiritual.

For amidst the grief, loss and unfairness of it all, running becomes the one place, where he feels light, free and strong. Where he can breathe. And where he may still be able to feel close to his dead daughter.

The piece is based on blogger Anders Legarth Schmidt's own experiences and opens up for questions of how you survive the loss of a child. I run is about running. But it is also about being helpless in the face of illness. And about the roles of death and grief in a society, which tries to hide death as a fact of life.

Meow Meow’s subversive cabaret is a fairytale gone rogue.

The legendary post-post-modern diva takes up residence in International Festival HQ for a festival-long run. Joined by a posse of DIY princes, she gives Hans Christian Andersen’s story of self-sacrifice, seduction and salvation a raucous contemporary make-over.

Meow Meow’s Little Mermaid is a wild and hilarious riot, colliding Andersen’s dark aquatic fantasy with her own mis-adventures in love, blending sparkling frivolity with fierce intelligence – and a blowtorch wit.

Casting salty sea shanties overboard, she conjures instead a glittering world of original songs and compositions by siren collaborators Amanda Palmer, Kate Miller-Heidke, Megan Washington and more. There's passion and poignancy as the mermaid longs to gain a human body, a human soul, the love of a prince... a happy ending.

Adored at last year’s International Festival singing lost and banned Weimar songs alongside Barry Humphries, Meow Meow is the queen of cabaret, mixing pin-sharp one-liners with a voice as smooth and intoxicating as absinthe . She is an award-winning actress, dancer and singer, whose unique brand of performance art exotica has hypnotised, inspired and terrified audiences from New York to Berlin, London to Sydney. She has performed her works with world renowned orchestras such as the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and for Pina Bausch’s Tanztheater Wuppertal amongst other groups and played Titania in Emma Rice's recent A Midsummer Night's Dream at Shakespeare's Globe.

Ms. Burden’s training technique, The Approach (often referred to as ""the most dangerous acting technique in the world""), fused Western acting methods with risk-based rituals in order to infuse even the smallest role with sex, death and violence. A play about the ecstasy and excesses of performing, the dangers of public intimacy and the incompatibility of truth on stage and sanity in real life.

Using found text from the journals and performance reports of Stella Burden’s company, “The Method Gun” re-enacts the final months of her company’s rehearsals for their nine-years-in-the-making production of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” Stella left the company under mysterious circumstances in 1972. Diaries and letters from actors in the company express a sense of desperation, inadequacy, and frustration inherent to the process of creating meaningful work for the stage and in everyday life. Set amid swinging pendulums and talking tigers, “The Method Gun” bounces between interior monologues, rehearsal sequences of “Streetcar,” and group interactions - all gleaned from historical documents - to express a longing for the return of inspiration and a more believable presentation of self in everyday life.

Gracie and Rose are two women who fall in love in Wyoming in the late 1950’s. Gracie has been passing as a man, George, for some time, in order to do men’s work and live the way she feels most authentic. They build a life together – hidden in love, while living in plain sight. As they contend with the intense demands of the land, the animals, and running a ranch, Rose wants to have a baby… with George. This piece unpacks pre-Stonewall queer history in the American West, the deep human longing to live authentically despite being rendered invisible, gender performance in a butch/femme tradition, the body as landscape for desire, and the violence and redemption of breaking and making family. This story is told in a physical theatre aesthetic harnessing the rich legacy of devising work through the movement-based actor training that I teach: Commedia Dell’Arte, Mask making and performance, Melodrama, Viewpoints, and the work of Le Coq, Grotwoski and Laban. What audiences love about this piece is the power of transformation they get to experience – a chair becomes a pig, a ladder is a wild horse, and a rope will save your hide or punish your spirit. One of the shows awarded “Best of Fringe extension” and nominated ""Best Solo Show"" in the 2013 Fringe.",,,

Creators Megan Cohen and Amy Clare Tasker's Build-Your-Own-Helen-of-Troy Play Kit constructs a new mythic icon each time the fragmented text is arranged and rearranged.

Images of Helen from Homer and Marlowe, from modern poetry, and even ripped from the headlines of our contemporary tabloids turn in a kaleidoscope of original and found text. We glimpse fleeting portraits of this mythic woman as each edition twists the mirrors to reflect a new Helen.

Like the text, Helen herself is fragmented. Five women – all Helen – crowd a bedroom, each making a decision that will change her life. Five Helens look into a mirror, asking, “is this the face that launched a thousand ships?”

The Helen Project has been performed in proscenium and immersive 5-actor editions in San Francisco and London. It is now in development as a solo performance in London.

Witness domestic drama, national scandal, and capital crimes—in a word, the everyday insanity of the world we live in.",,,

Mystery Spot was awarded First Place winner in the 2010 Santa Cruz Actors Theatre Full Length Play Contest. It was one of four plays selected for reading in the 2008 Ashland New Plays Festival.

Radio City Austin is a comedic radio serial style podcast that is set (and recorded) in Austin, Texas, a town that is proudly famous for being weird. It’s the liberal-hippie capital of a severely conservative state and it’s full of college students, start up companies and ambitious musicians. If there is one thing that can be said about Austonites, it is that they are independent minded. So what happens when you cram hundreds of thousands of independent minded people into a city where temperatures rise above 100 degrees more than seventy five days out of the year? You get enough hilarious drama to write an entire serial about.

Season one of Radio City Austin features the adventures of a variety of fictional Austin characters as their paths cross. Some of them have something to prove, some of them are hoping to find love, and some are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The aim of the project is to feature a variety of Austin performers and playwrights in a way that celebrates Austin’s creative culture while also providing Austin talent with a platform that has the potential to reach listeners around the world. The eight episode series will feature the work of over a dozen locally recognized Austin actors and four Austin-based writers.

""The play focuses on a longing for magic, a wish for a transformative power...A compelling performance, enhanced by haunting cello music... It celebrates human ingenuity.""   - The New York Times

""It’s romantic in an old-fashioned way...lovely music...Carlo Adinolfi's performance is charming.""  -The New Yorker 


Extraordinary Extremities is a tale of resilience, adaptation and ingenuity that tells the story of puppet-maker Geppetto, who is attempting to perform — all by himself for the first time ever — the grand mythical love story of Perseus, who slays a sea monster to save his beloved Andromeda. During the show things begin to go haywire, and Geppetto finds himself desperately improvising to overcome the challenges of performing solo while at the same time scrambling to devise new story lines, new characters, and even new limbs.
 
Extraordinary Extremities was inspired by a NPR story on Hugh Herr, whose legs were amputated after a climbing accident and who now designs technologically advanced artificial limbs. Hugh himself has different pairs of feet that he switches out for different activities. He feels fortunate that he can always look forward to having better and better feet.",[],,[]

Im Internet geht inzwischen so einiges. So kann man Plakate, Handzettel allerdings auch Notizbloecke individuell drucken lassen, meist zuegig und des Weiteren guenstig. Auch der Bedruckte Aufkleber ist moeglich. Hierbei haben Sie eine grosse Auswahl an Materialien wie auch Groessen. Aufkleber auf klebendem Papier gibt es fuer den Innen- und Outdoorbereich wie auch in hunderten moeglichen Formen. Sie haben die Wahl unter Papier wie auch PVC-Folie, matt oder auch irisierend oder durchsichtig. Diese Klebezettel sind ausserordentlich haltbar wie auch Wasser- und wetterfest. chromolux perlmutt  Solche lassen sich auch wiederum leicht wieder abziehen. 
 
Prinzipiell hat jedes Unternehmen einen grossen Bedarf an Druckmedien und hiermit ausserdem an Druckerei-Partnern, welche jene hochwertig wie auch angepasst an den Bedarf der Firmen durchfuehren koennen. 
 
Werbung kann vielfaeltig sein. Hierbei gehoert keinesfalls nur das Drucken von Bierdeckeln, sondern nicht zuletzt das drucken von Faltblaettern, was unter Einsatz von Internet-Druckereien qualitativ hochstehend ausgefuehrt werden kann. 
 
Sobald ein Unternehmen hochwertige Drucke zum Beispiel fuer Plakaten, Flyern, Karten oder Firmenbroschueren wuenscht, sollten diese hochwertig gedruckt sein. Dafuer kommt nur der Profi auf diesem Gebiet infrage. Mehrfach werden solche Drucke zu Werbezwecken genutzt wie auch speziell hier ist die erste Wahrnehmung erheblich. Dafuer kommt der Digital Druck infrage, welcher ein professionelles Ergebnis erreichen kann.",,,

""[...]two plays that specifically spoke to economic theory, in the same way that Copenhagen speaks to physics or The Hard Problem speaks to brain science. [...]Clearing Bombs by Eric Samuelson imagines a conversation between two major 20th century economists stuck on a rooftop during WWII and passing the time with a deep but lively economic debate. Jan Kultura, Substitute Teacher, Meets the Crowd by Ian Thal is a short play that essentially presents a case study of crowd sourced creativity as a vehicle to steal ideas from people without having to pay them – well larded with good economic thinking. These stood out to me as good examples of scripts we could stand to have more of.""

Its protagonist is a woman, who is not an individual; she is a multitude, a swarm. This is not an animal play, it is a vegetable play.

Based on the revolutionary thinking of plant philosopher Michael Marder and plant neurobiologist Stefano Mancuso, the exploration consists of probing the ways in which new concepts such as plant intelligence, vegetative soul, or plant communication can transform our creative practice.

If we accept that plants have other ways of thinking, feeling, communicating, other way of being intelligent, a diferent form of consciousness and another notion of time, perhaps we can see our own notions of thinking, feeling, communicating and being aware, transformed. In Michael Marder’s words, “recognizing a “valid “other” in plants is also beginning to recognize that vegetal other within us”.

Violent, emotional and visceral, Faust invites the audience to a strong individual experience about pain, death and love. A milestone in the history of the Romanian theatre, Faust directed by Silviu Purcărete, distinguishes itself through the artistic vision and the complexity of the roles presented in the baroque construction of the set design, mastered to the smallest, with vivid details: impressive set and light design, elegant and burlesque costumes, entertaining and overwhelming music with appropriate sound effects that add to that eccentric environment, video projections ingeniously framed in the architecture of the whole stage approach, that is monumentally created with the help of over 100 actors, performed in an abandoned industrial hall.

Discover an extrasensory experience placed between Earth and Hell, a scenery amplified by video projections, fireworks, live original rock music, tens of actors and dancers and an original soundtrack created by Vasile Şirli, musical director of Disneyland Paris. The script of this performance catches the essential of Goethe’s text: the pact with the devil, Faust’s sick fascination for Margaret, the Walpurgis Night and Faust’s rise to Heaven.","['Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['Romania'],

Precisamente, el título, Moaré, hace referencia a un fenómeno óptico que hace que, al percibir dos tramas superpuestas, nuestro cerebro capte un nuevo patrón inexistente que puede llegar a formar incluso dibujos. Esta idea inspira un espectáculo que parte de la mirada como interpretación y percepción subjetiva y, por tanto, creación. Cuestiones como la construcción de la propia identidad a partir de la mirada de los demás son, pues, algunos de los conceptos sobre los que gira esta coreografía. Y es que, ¿vemos las cosas tal como son… o tal como somos?

Emma's lesson to learn is that unlike playing with her dolls as a child, the people of Highbury are flesh and blood, and messing with their love lives can cause some real consequences!

Emma's latest project is Miss Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, who Emma takes under her wing, and coaches her to be amongst high society.  Leading her affections away from an unworthy mate in Emma's eyes, and directing her towards a new suitor leads to unrequited love, broken hearts, and general confusion.

They depict the life of a nation from top to bottom – from king to beggar.  They also show the development of Henry's son, Hal, into the future King Henry V.

Henry V was seen by Shakespeare as the ideal king.  However, as a teenager, he led a wild, dissolute life, frequenting the taverns of London with thieves, whores and other disreputables, chief among them the greatest of all Shakespeare's comic creations – Sir John Falstaff. 

Hal's stern father, Henry IV – already riddled with guilt over his having deposed Richard II – is haunted by the fear that his son will lead the county into ruin.

Which of these two men will more greatly influence the wayward Hal, and help him achieve the transition from irresponsible prince to responsible king?

Drawing on four of Shakespeare's history plays, Rob Croser has woven an enthralling play, which charts the education of Prince Hal at the hands of his two father-figures, as the new king remembers, and tries to find a way to bind his people together.

Every word in this remarkable theatre piece is Shakespeare's.","['Classical', 'Translations / Adaptations']",,

So began a life of endless observation. But curiosity works both ways, and Merrick returned the horrified gaze of Victorian punters and nurses with wonder and optimism.

This story has inspired multiple theatrical adaptations, novels and a film by David Lynch. Now the team behind Malthouse Theatre’s Picnic at Hanging Rock, director Matthew Lutton and playwright Tom Wright, reunite to create a poignant new work that uncovers empathy in a world that rejects difference.

The first season of this play at The Meteor in May 2017 was a sold-out success and received audience and critical acclaim. This instant classic tells an intriguing local story as it examines the great political battle in the 1930’s – between the Hamilton borough engineer Rupert Worley, HCC and ratepayers- over removing the hill that once covered Garden Place.  This show was such a sold-out successor it's opening season, that we had to bring it back by popular demand!
The local politics still resonate. How much debt should be taken on by the council?  How much does personality shape policy decisions? Who should drive the decision-making process – council, the ratepayers, or ‘experts’? The audience at each performance, having heard all the arguments, get to vote on what they would have selected- keeping or cutting the hill!
Worley was an extraordinary man, at only 23 he was directing engineering works on the Western front in WW1 and was later awarded international prizes in Paris for his world leading engineering innovations in Hamilton. ‘OneHill of a Fight’ reveals the immense hidden strain that survivors of the Great War felt when they returned to civilian life in New Zealand.

There are over sixty characters in the original, drawn from all levels of society. The narrative is set in Yutai teahouse in Beijing and focuses on the experiences of the manager Wang and his customers. Teahouse mirrors three critical moments in Chinese history: the first part focuses on the 1898 Reform Movement; the second on the battles between warlords during the initial years of the Republic of China (1912 – 1916); while the final part sets after the war of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937 – 1945). The drama brings alive the social transitions from the twilight of Imperial China to the dawn of the People’s Republic of China.

The original play was radical when first staged. After the author Lao She’s death in 1966, Teahouse became one of the targets during the Cultural Revolution. Beijing People’s Arts Theatre therefore, stopped showing it until 1979, and the play was not widely performed for the public till 1985.  Then, it was staged in realistic style with “fourth wall” technique. Now, this new adaption will tell the story through the memory of the teahouse manager, Wang. The dramatic shift in perspective transforms the play from realism to hyperrealism: characters, plots and sets are all transformed and are rich with messages open to complexities of reflection and interpretation.","['Devised / Ensemble', 'International', 'Translations / Adaptations', 'Political / Social Engagement']","['United Kingdom', 'China']",['Chinese']

But for now, they need to make money: get out the guitar, switch on the amplifier and drown out all the racists, machos and car horns until only cash is left, money and fame are lying on the street and a new world is born where everything is different. Unfortunately this plan requires a woman to be in a good mood and with boundless energy to confront the world. And today, for once, that’s not the case, or is it?

 

Call me Queen was created by Thandi Sebe – dialogues rattled off in video clip speed, the everyday toughness of this city life culminating in a strong Black women Berlin story...

 

Anyone who has seen Jung, giftig und Schwarz by Amina Eisner and Thandi Sebe will recognize some moments of this life: a relationship of two smart women, the abysses of society, and an intelligent-ironic battle of words developed to perfection. But since life does not only consist of clubbing and morning after breakfast, Thandi Sebe ups the ante with Call me Queen: career, grief, empty stomachs, roots or the present, family and love, and the possibility of revolution – a Black perspective of Berlin.

Tomo wartet auf den Haftrichter. Marc sucht die richtige Krawatte für seine Antrittsvorlesung. Zwei Brüder. Damals, als er noch nicht schwimmen konnte, versuchte Tomo das Meer rappend zu besänftigen; sein Bruder Marc nahm sich vor, ein einwandfreies Leben zu führen: Familie,

Jetzt sitzt Tomo im Gefängnis. Statt der Hilfe kommt der Zweifel. Statt der Anklage die öffentliche Vorverurteilung in den Schlagzeilen. Statt des Vaters der Bruder. Und statt des unabhängigen Haftrichters kommt Steven.

 

Die Vergangenheit staut sich in der Zelle, Schichten des Verdrängten verdicken die Wände.

In just two years a farmer's daughter from the countryside had become an icon and role model, and in the end would fall victim to political power struggles.

Guided by religious visions, Joan of Arc meddled in the endless war between France, Burgundy and England. Her sense of mission and subsequent victories for France seemed to confirm that she was right. She was merciless in her divine campaign. But with her defeats also came her fall: she had become a symbol that had to be destroyed. The same church that extinguished her life would later proclaim her to be a martyr and saint. When Friedrich Schiller wrote The Maid of Orleans in 1800, he constructed Joan as a pure character in the conflict between emotions and ideology of truth and plaything for male political intrigue. Up to the present day, contemporary conflicts have been reflected more in the story of the young woman from Lorraine than in virtually any other material. While Marine Le Pen positions herself as a modern Joan of Arc, young Islamist warriors follow divine promptings and by attacking the editors of Charlie Hebdo, strike the heart of the Western concept of freedom.
The Paris-based director Mikaël Serre uses Schiller's tragedy as a starting point for a project on the idea of nations, religious fanaticism, radical forms of empowerment and those ideological gaps which reactionists and nationalists fill by invoking the holy warrior Joan of Arc.

Anyone who wants to allude to the current political situation in the Middle East in Hebrew or Arabic speaks simply of »The Situation«. Over the past several years many people with roots in »The Situation« have ended up in Berlin, of all places, on their search for a new beginning. Approximately 30,000 Israelis have moved to the former »capital of the perpetrators«, an estimated 5,000 Syrians. Many of them live in Kreuzkölln, next door to long-established German Palestinians and Lebanese. Their families mostly didn't »move« fled here. What was previously separated by social and physical walls develops into a new Middle East in Berlin. 

In her new devised piece, Yael Ronen and the participating actors, whose biographies are intertwined with the conflict in the Middle East, grapple with these paradoxical re-encounters with the »neighbours«. They are all connected by the fact that they recently came to Berlin because the reality in their countries offers little hope for a peaceful future. But as much as the desire to escape from »The Situation« unites them, the motivations for moving are different: war has been raging in Syria since 2011, and in Israel and Palestine the political and social climate has become increasingly militant. Rents in Tel Aviv are exploding and life is no longer affordable for those with an average income. Any attempt to criticise the policy of occupation and governmental positions is either ridiculed or branded as a betrayal. Over 1.7 million people in Israel belong to the Palestinian minority, but discrimination against them creates little opportunity for social participation. And in the West Bank, a fourth generation is now growing up under occupation.

The Situation dusts off the confused road map of the Middle East. The sand that trickles down tells stories of dispossession, disbelief and anger, but also of the search for a life beyond the wars in Berlin.

One can lose any hope very quickly if you look at the current state of the political and cultural Europe. Mephistoland is a horror scenario, a vision and yet a reality. Here the artistic director has been replaced and his successor now represents a »healthy, nationalist« culture. Homophobia and anti Semitism and giant statues of saints are being introduced as confessions of faith for a new era. Schizophrenia spreads, directors go crazy, actors change their beings, and the audience locks itself in cages and goes on hunger strike. A theatre company is in a state of emergency because the groups knows: The time where they just played and acted for the sake of it will be over soon. The feared minister president has put his best friends in the position as the new artistic director of the theatre who thinks that the main goal of theatre should be to enhance the mental and spiritual uprising of the people. The wind is changing and from now on there is no chance to avoid the slump of politics into the area of art. The Hungarian director András Dömötör has created a deeply weird trip through an absurd world in which reality and fiction, horror and grotesque cheerfully pair.

Chaos in the megapolis of Chicago: Malaysian lumber dealer Shlink enters a lending library and asks to buy the opinion of its clerk, George Garga. This starts a fight without rules, without morals, without motive, in which both opponents put everything on the line. Garga loses his position because of Shlink's provocation, who then forces Garga's girlfriend and sister Marie into prostitution and also manages to put Garga in jail. In so doing, he not only ruins Garga's family financially, but also destroys its cohesion. Garga denounces Shlink for raping his sister and begins a campaign to lynch him. It is a battle of life and death, a fight in the jungle in which people only seem to be close through struggle.

 

Baumgarten's work is always characterized by the use of different media, a line that connects to the epic theatre of Bertolt Brecht. In Dickicht Baumgarten experiments with the epic form: the whole piece was produced as a film and put on stage in one abstract space. With this formal experiment Baumgarten radicalises Brecht's distancing effect.

 

 

»The separation of picture and sound is as virtuoso as it is astonishing. On the one hand, it condenses the conflicts and, on the other, prevents identification with the characters, in the sense of Brecht and his command: »Don't stare that romantically!« The goal of Brecht's alienation effect - that the actors as well as the audience are thinking and not merely empathising – is emphasised by Baumgarten with contemporary means. The ensemble follows him brilliantly, but remains cool in all its passions and euphoric in all its clarity of mind.« (FAZ, Irene Bazinger)

Once again, it's all about Us Against Them: The authoritarians - old alpha males, the women of the new right front – are propagating their ideas of nation and identity. And the others are “the traitors”. But, in this end-times scenario, what does the concept of “traitor” really mean?

Following his explorations in SMALL TOWN BOY, Falk Richter turns again to the trouble spots in our current state, which, in the face of alarming political developments, is characterized by helplessness, excessive demands, and self-centred paranoia. For this research project, actors Mareike Beykirch, Mehmet Ateşçi, Knut Berger, Orit Nahmias, Daniel Lommatzsch and Çiğdem Teke work toward defining these questions: What makes one into a traitor? What have we betrayed? With whom have we collaborated?

The starting point for their journey towards a political and personal family constellation is a children's room in the 90s. There the protagonists found an intrepid garage band and, with musical accompaniment ranging from Depeche Mode to punk and Whitney Houston, enter gleefully and self-deprecatingly into a convoluted field of conflict. They tell of blind spots in their own family histories and what has been left unsaid, comb through Trump's tweets, hate speech as today's rhetorical mechanisms - and continue to stubbornly search for a vision of a diverse society of the many.

But I fired four shots more into the inert body, the bullets pierced it without leaving any trace. And it was as though I was making four short raps on the door of misfortune.«

In Albert Camus’ 1942-published novel »The Stranger«, the Frenchman Meursault becomes by chance a murderer. He kills an Arab on the beach at Algiers. He does not defend himself in the subsequent trial, even though it ends in him being sentenced to death. He, the passive spectator of his own life, follows what happens to him so dispassionately as if it were happening to someone else. And it appears that the death sentence has less to do with the murder of the Arab, who remains nameless throughout, than with Meursault’s apathy which he  recognises as inherent in the world.

»The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world« writes Camus in his essay »The Myth of Sisyphus«, also published in 1942. According to him, the realisation that existence and the world are unbearably meaningless can befall anyone at any time. We must acknowledge that there is no higher significance and accept unconditionally what we cannot change. Camus’ stranger is a paragon of the absurd: Meursault not only embraces the randomness of his life but also, with a shrug, his own death.

8HYpWaxAAJ8NX4ipJ,Professor Bernhardi,"[{'_id': 'RhPouzBdyY5MpfRqC', 'name': 'Thomas Ostermeier'}]","Specialist for internal medicine Bernhardi, the director of a prestigious private clinic, refuses to allow a priest into the room of a patient to whom the priest wants to give the last rites. In the final stages of a deadly sepsis, caused by an improper abortion, the delirious young woman believes she is fully recovered and Bernhardi sees it as his medical duty to grant her a »happy death« and not to destroy her delusion. The priest in turn insists upon his religious mission as the saviour of souls. Both men fail: whilst they argue, the patient dies – but not before she has been startled by the nursing staff who, against the doctor’s wishes, have announced the priest’s visit.

For Bernhardi, who is of Jewish descent, this unfortunate incident quickly escalates into a political scandal which threatens to ruin his existence and that of the clinic. He is accused of a targeted attack on the religious feelings of Christians. Soon a rampant latent anti-Semitism breaks out into the open. The clinic’s board of trustees resigns as a protest against Bernhardi. Rivals in the medical community deliberately use anti-Jewish resentments to suspend Bernhardi and manoeuvre themselves and their friends into leading positions. In parliament, right-wing populists even succeed in having criminal proceedings opened against Bernhardi. Finally, even the minister in charge himself, Bernhardi’s university friend Flint, withholds his support in order not to endanger his political programme with this individual case. Bernhardi instead experiences sudden solidarity from left-wing circles who want to make him a martyr. But he does not want to become an instrument of their political goals – and deliberately foregoes a public fight against the lies and for his rehabilitation.

»Professor Bernhardi« is one of the few dramatic texts which meticulously develops a professional context beyond the emotional and family backgrounds of its characters. At the same time, the hospital workplace comes to represent a cross section of a society dominated by careerism, competition and resentment, underpinned by the latent driving force of its anti-semitism. In his production of Schnitzler’s comedy – as the writer ambiguously termed his play – Thomas Ostermeier particularly explores the question of how a group can systematically manipulate an isolated incident in order to serve its own aspirations for power and special interests; how apparently incontestable facts can be twisted and relativised to the point where the »objective truth« rapidly loses its definable shape. What remains of the truth when it is increasingly crushed between opposing interpretations?",[],['Germany'],['German']

In short sequences, Jonas Hassen Khemiri tells of hope and failure in an incessantly self-optimising neo-liberal society, links life stories with economic theories and creates characters somewhere between powerlessness and hubris, repression and bitter realisation.

Images of the drowned on Mediterranean beaches or victims of civil war and disease in Central Africa: the crises and disasters of our time are ubiquitous in our Facebook timelines, on television and in the press. 

In »Compassion. The History of the Machine Gun«, Rau and his team journey to the political hot spots of our time: the Mediterranean routes of refugees from the Middle East and the Congolese civil war zones. The semi-documentary double-monologue, based on interviews with NGO workers, clerics and war victims in Africa and Europe, deliberately ventures into contradictory terrain: how do we endure the misery of others and why do we watch it? Why does one dead person at the gates of Europe outweigh thousand dead people in the Congolese civil war zones? »Compassion. The History of the Machine Gun« not only contemplates the limits of our compassion but also on the limits of European humanism.

Horváth’s death had something of a strictly artistic consequence. It integrates quite organically into his work which »frequently jumps over the fence to the hereafter with a boisterous leap«. And in fact his characters, whether underprivileged young women or sanctimonious widows, messed-up intellectuals, Casimirs and Carolines, coppers or cutters, are all tinged with an air of melancholy, a sense of longing and, whenever there is nothing to help them here on earth, a tendency to gaze up at the stars.

A sound studio. An actress is recording a text. At the mixing desk a director is giving her instructions. Together they are working on the voice recording for a film which is running synchronously in the background. It is a documentary essay called »Returning to Reims« – a cinematic adaptation of the eponymous book by French sociologist Didier Eribon. The protagonist of the film is the author himself who goes on a type of journey of reminiscence. With a mixture of personal confession and sociological analysis, Eribon reports on the re-encounter with his hometown and his family which, since his career as an intellectual in Paris, he has hardly seen for decades, and has had no desire to see. In his confrontation with his own past, Eribon also comes up against the blind spots in contemporary society: the brutal exclusion mechanisms at work in the very same middle-classes to which he now belongs and the reality of a previously communist working-class which, forgotten and disenfranchised, is now running into the right-wing populist arms of the Front National. How can things have come to this? How much is the left-wing to blame, how much Eribon himself who, as an intellectual, has renounced his past? And what are the solutions? These are all questions Eribon pursues in his film as he goes on a search for clues in Reims. They are questions which also continue to trouble the director and actress during their process of finishing the film – and which ultimately lead to a conflict which puts what was considered to be a completed project to the test and simultaneously exposes hidden aspects of the protagonists’ personal biographies.

With »Returning to Reims« Thomas Ostermeier is bringing to the stage for the first time in the German language Didier Eribon’s text which, since its publication, has become a key work in the understanding of contemporary society.

Can a just system in which everyone co-exists in liberty, equality and fraternity be politically achieved? What is the price of taking on the responsibility to fight against prevailing injustice and for a utopian dream? Or should we not bother to fight at all and just give in because human beings who constantly »lie, kill and steal« are simply not fit for the realisation of such ideals?

In 1794 the French Revolution is well and truly descending into crisis: the proclamation of universal human rights, the creation of a constitution and formation of a national assembly means the monarchy is toppled and the republic is founded but the bearers of the revolution, the people and the common citizens, continue to live in misery, poverty and starvation. The spoils of the deposed have been divided up into the hands of a new elite and the Reign of Terror which decapitates the king and countless other opponents of the revolution is the only thing currently making any progress. Discord rules amongst the revolutionaries about which political direction to take from here: in such a situation, how much freedom may be sacrificed for equality, how much equality for freedom? Robespierre champions universal equality of all people and of property ownership. To him the Terror, guillotining every opponent of this goal, is a legitimate means of achieving this objective. Danton looks with disillusion upon the barbarities which have besmirched the high ideals of the revolution with blood. He believes the murdering must stop and a new order be established in which everyone can live in freedom and strive after their own interests. In this, he is defending not only humanity but also his own privileges: since the revolution he has been living in luxury and prefers to spend his time with prostitutes and gambling rather than with politics.

Peter Kleinert and his ensemble of third year students from the »Ernst Busch« Academy of Dramatic Arts take the conflict between idealism and pragmatism in Büchner’s play as a starting point to explore the question of the realisation of liberty, equality and fraternity in today’s world.

Hamlet is going crazy. His father has died suddenly of a strange disease, and his mother has married her deceased husband’s brother, of all people, after just one month. Hamlet has nighttime visions of his father, who claims his brother poisoned him, and exhorts Hamlet to take revenge and kill his new stepfather. Hamlet acts the part of the crazy man in order to hide his plans, and loses his grip on reality in the process. The whole world becomes a stagnant swamp to him. Desire and sexuality become a threatening abyss. The friends surrounding him turn out to be spies deployed by his stepfather to keep an eye on him. Even Ophelia, his beloved, is a part of the scheme. The avenger becomes the prey, with an informer listening behind every curtain, as Hamlet’s paranoia proves to be not unfounded. The insane act turns to actual insanity, and Hamlet kills the wrong man: Polonius, Ophelia’s father. His mother and stepfather cover up the murder and keep Hamlet out of the public eye, and Hamlet’s plans for revenge seem to evaporate. He loses control of himself, his goals, and his life. Ophelia falls apart in the face of this and kills herself. When his stepfather decides finally to silence Hamlet, Hamlet seizes the opportunity at hand and with one final rampage forces his world to its knees.

Shakespeare represents the Danish royal court as a corrupt political system which becomes a paranoid maze for Hamlet. Murder, betrayal, manipulation and sexuality are the weapons used in the war to preserve power. Not able to take on and fight the cynical rules of the game at the court, Hamlet stagnates and turns his aggressions against himself. His gift of distinguishing pros and cons becomes an insurmountable hindrance in accomplishing his goals, and as the last person with scruples in a system without any, he is finally doomed. With its central paradox of the incapacitated protagonist, Hamlet remains today a valid analysis of the intellectual dilemma between complex thinking and political action. Shakespeare serves up over twenty characters, allowing a political biosphere to arise out of differing interests and intrigue. In Ostermeier’s production, just six actors will play all these characters, constantly changing roles. Hamlet’s progressive loss of touch with reality, his disorientation, the manipulation of reality and identity are mirrored in the acting style, which takes pretence and disguise as its basic principle.

Bei dem Versuch, die Bittschrift Kohlhaases direkt an den brandenburgischen Kurfürsten zu überreichen, stirbt Kohlhaas Frau.

Kohlhaas beginnt einen Rachefeldzug gegen den Junker  von Tronka. Gemeinsam mit Herse und Unterstützern überfällt er die Tronkenburg, brennt sie nieder und tötet alle Bewohner. Der Junker selbst entkommt. Kohlhaas verfasst ein Mandat, in dem er allen Unterstützern Wenzel von Tronkas mit der Todesstrafe droht.  Martin Luther, der Kohlhaas zuvor öffentlich verurteilt hat bewirkt nach einem Treffen mit Kohlhaas dessen freies Geleit nach Dresden, um die Klage erneut vor Gericht bringen zu können.

Eine Allianz des  Königs von Polen mit dem Kurfürsten von Brandenburg gegen das Haus Sachsen bringt den Kurfürsten von Brandenburg dazu, sich für Kohlhaas einzusetzen.
Er bietet ihm einen erneuten fairen Prozess an. Der führt zwar zur Verurteilung des Junkers von Tronka auf Schadensersatz, allerdings wird zugleich auch Kohlhaas wegen Landfriedensbruch zum Tode verurteilt.

„Regisseur Stefan Hermann hat sich in seiner Inszenierung der Kleist’schen Novelle im Euro Theater Central (…) den Mensch hinter dem Monster herausgearbeitet und hat so ein tief bewegendes Solo geschaffen, das einmal mehr zeigt, dass ein gutes Stück keine großen Bühnenbilder oder Technikspielereien braucht, keinen Pomp und kein riesiges Ensemble – sondern nur einen guten Text. Und einen überragenden Schauspieler. Letzteren hat Hermann in Michael Meichßner gefunden. Auf kleinstem Raum, eingepfercht in einer winzigen Zelle mit nicht viel mehr als einem Schemel auf einem strohbedeckten Boden, spielt dieser mit beeindruckender Virtuosität auf der Klaviatur der Emotionen, während er als Kohlhaas von jenen Ereignissen erzählt, die aus einem unbescholtenen Pferdehändler von den Ufern der Havel einen gefährlichen Mordbrenner und Plünderer gemacht haben.“ -General-Anzeiger Bonn, 26.11.16

Wer ist Lisa? Was für eine Ehe führten sie? Mühsam versucht er seine Vergangenheit, sein Leben zu rekonstruieren.

BONN. Die neue Spielzeit im Euro Theater Central wurde mit dem Stück „Der eingebildete Kranke“ eröffnet – und das mit einer richtiggehenden, typischen Molière-Szene. In ihr sitzt Johannes K. Prill mit Tuch um den Kopf im Lehnstuhl, schwer leidend. Aber nicht an den eingebildeten Krankheiten, sondern an den Arztrechnungen, die ihm ins Haus flattern, seine eigentliche Krankheit. Der Zorn über die habgierigen Mediziner treibt ihn um. Im Parkett war das der Lacher. Einige lachten dabei sicher auch auf eigene Kosten.

Nun ist es aber auch keine neue Geschichte, die Marianne de Pury inszeniert hat im Zimmertheater am Dreieck.Sondern eher eine, für die sich die Regisseurin, von vielen Gelegenheiten erfahren mit der kleinen Bühne, aparte Lösungen einfallen ließ zusammen mit Thomas Ziegler. Da wird auch schon mal was auf den Kopf gestellt, zur Hauptsache wird irgendwann, was sich Frau de Pury einfallen ließ, um der Geschichte den theatralischen Halt zu geben. Was nicht ganz leicht ist, wenn man nur fünf Schauspieler hat für ein Dutzend Rollen. Nur zwei oder drei Figuren fallen unter den Tisch, den es auch nicht braucht. Also die Accessoires – die Hüte, Brillen, Schürzen, die von einem Träger zum anderen wechseln. Der Hut macht den Notar, die Brille den Apotheker, beides zusammen den Bruder. Nur die zwei wichtigsten Rollen bleiben an ihre Personen gebunden – der eingebildete Kranke als die reine Unvernunft und Virginie Cointe als Dienerin Toinette als die reine Vernunft.

In einer französischen Komödie ist die Vernunft natürlich eine Französin, die wunderbar komisch parliert und grimassiert, eine sehr schöne Besetzung. Alle anderen werden von Stephan Tacke-Unterberg (4) und Franz Jürgen Zigelski (4) gegeben und von Sandra Pohl (2) – darunter dann aber auch neben dem Arzt die schöne Rolle der verliebten Tochter Angélique. Auch die kleine Bühneneinrichtung funktionierte knapp und fix, so dass man nicht einmal zwei Stunden brauchte, um alles, fast alles, zu erzählen. Vergnügt machten also die Verkürzungen, die sich Molière von Marianne de Pury gefallen lassen musste, ohne dass dadurch die üblichen Komödienelemente Schaden genommen hätten. Auch das gute Ende blieb lustig mit der Empfehlung an den eingebildet kranken Argan, es mal mit der Selbstmedikamentierung zu probieren. Und Angélique bekam auch ihren Cléante.

Milk Presents drop a bull into a gender shop and hope it breaks everything. A wild show about not taming the minotaur within.

In BULLISH, ancient mythology meets modern gender negotiation. Inspired by Ovid’s Minotaur, a gender fierce ensemble of hopers and renegades try to pass, pack and blag their way out of the labyrinth.

BULLISH is the recipient of Camden People’s Theatre and Jerwood Charitable Foundation Home Run Commission and will premiere at Camden People’s Theatre in September 2017 for a three-week run. The development of BULLISH has been generously supported by Arts Council England and Derby Theatre.

The FEMS: a garish explosion of flamingo monsters who come to party, to play and to destroy toxic masculinity.

This flock of glittering outcasts, fresh from the sequinned swamp, present a kamikaze cabaret and monstrous melodrama. THE FEMS – terrifying embodiments of femininity – take us on a glittering tour to show that “sometimes it’s hard to be a Fem” – but the alternative is even grimmer.

A parent seeking advice from a minister about his effeminate son, a bacchanal Women’s Institute meeting and a text from a ‘neomasculinity’ blog: THE FEMS skewer hypocrisies and hate with series of blasphemous and boisterous sketches – while probing themselves and their audience for their own femphobia.

THE FEMS (which are “Fem”, “Femme” or any derivation that fills the glittering space between the poles of perceived gender) are a bouffon chorus of unashamedly evil clowns. They combine the skills of our collective (spanning performance artists to musical theatre), the fun and fierceness of our strange play, and the topical relevance of a world of bathroom policing and gendered Lego.

A singular riotous, vicious, silly choral piece musing on masc vs. fem culture and the systems that keep this perfidious framework in place.

So imagine this: You are 14 years old and you are a drag queen. It’s golden stilettos, ripped fishnets, shoulder pads, and neon bobs. It’s expression. It’s glamour. It’s power. It’s Doncaster, 2009.

This autobiographical, three person show combines drag performance with theatrical storytelling to build the world of Bonnie Love and The Bonnettes. Set against a backdrop of pop anthems and glitter we follow Cameron as he throws himself into a pair of 6-inch stilettos – meeting new people making both friends and foes. But not everything is as it seems and, piece by piece, the glamorous world of drag fades away.

It’s about being young, having that fire in your belly and seeing no limitations or rules. It’s the uncertainty of your own identity and the creation of a new one. It’s about finding a safe place between the two. Between boy and drag. It’s a reflection. An exorcism. A scrapbook.

The show was remounted in January of 2017 as the headliner of the Bouge D’ici dance Festival and is hitting both the Regina and Vancouver International Fringe Festivals. 

A David Lynch Wet Dream is a one woman show centering around a character trying to find her place within a harsh and intangible landscape. It is a story about leaving the clutches of naivety and grappling with the ever-changing nature of identity. The piece uses the disturbing yet beautiful Lynchian world to bring its protagonist to terms with the absurdity of being alive. 

The movement based theatre piece incorporates clown like play contrasted by visceral dance. Making use of projection and sound design the audience is plunged into a world of color and light and cacophonic sound.

The exhibit, developed with the cooperation of the Fundación Augusto y León Ferrari, Arte y Acervo (FALFAA), focuses primarily on Ferrari’s influential practice from the 1960s to the 1980s, with a particular emphasis on Ferrari’s literary collages, most notably Palabras ajenas, an important Vietnam era anti-war piece written in the form of a dramatic script. Ferrari created the work by cutting and assembling texts and quotations from various sources, including news agencies, history books, the Bible, and speeches by such political and religious figures as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Robert McNamara, Pope Paul VI and Adolph Hitler.

The September 16 durational performance in the theater at REDCAT is the first time the entire piece will be performed. Partial readings have been held at the Arts Lab in London (1968) and in Buenos Aires at the Larrañaga Theater (1972).

In this setting, the audience is presented with ambivalent mass dynamics and bodies which purposefully refuse singular interpretations, which the choreography draws on. Running and falling, moving in circles and sculptural tableaus, the bodies – which are permanently transforming and taking on new forms which are at turns animalistic, artificial, sacral or object-like – receive new ascriptions of meaning.

As a result, the work serves as both an interrogation of the state of the craft and a surprising portrait of the artist, enacted by 10 strangers.

ABOUT PENTIMENTO // Pentimento was formed by Isabel Toledo and Itzel Aparicio. Their work focuses on the the development of intimate projects that rescue outdated communication channels for a new generation. Scenic devices are activated by the viewer, encouraging them to become a critical collaborator in the construction of fiction. Pentimento has participated in residencies with Zurcher Theater Spekatkle and the Kunsten Festival das Arts, in addition to working with museums, galleries, and theaters in Mexico City.

PLAY is presented in English.","['Immersive', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'New Technology', 'New Work', 'Performance Art']",['Mexico'],['English']

Moore, Toonkel and Shank adapted the play and, in collaboration with the performers, distilled it into episodic performances that are simultaneously autobiographical, pedestrian and theatrical. Each performance invited male-identified audiences into the bedrooms of women across Los Angeles in an exploration of sexuality, intimacy and domestic locations and functioned as a staged photo shoot, with Shank’s photographs creating narrative photo-documentation that further explores the male gaze.

The LAX Festival will host the artists for a week-long residency and open studio at Automata, opening doors to the full series of episodic performances in a gallery setting.","['Performance Art', 'Theatre for or by Women', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['United States'],

Amie Cota and Christopher Bordenave of No)one. Art House portray the story young of a African-American man migrating out of the South and heading toward an unnamed urban center.  The songs and movement tell of his hope as guiding force, his drive toward dignity, and his search for the elusive feeling of belonging in a divided country.

Nearly four decades later, L.A.’s celebrated theater ensemble confronts Group Therapy, a new work of documentary theater that mirrors that film’s voyeuristic lens and delves into 16 hours of the Group’s actual transcribed therapy with a licensed professional.

After more than a decade of creating theater together, this tight-knit group of collaborators amplify their self-interrogation into an uncensored—sometimes funny, sometimes poignant—work of live art. Through chance operations, each performance of Group Therapy originates in a past encounter, then quickly spins into spontaneous reflections, real-time (re)recordings and cinematic gestures. As the members of Poor Dog Group process their divorces, dependencies, privileges and vulnerabilities, they create a portrait of a generation’s hustle, and, above all, what it is like to endure.

GROUP THERAPY is commissioned by The Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA and was created as part of its Artists-in-Residency program, with additional residency support from The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and Headlands Center for the Arts.

This half-bird, half girl is an embodied metaphor, a symbolic way to talk about the madness and suicide that can run through generations of families. So while this is an intimate story about one woman’s family, it speaks to countless others who have dealt with the pain and sorrow of mental illness in their own. It is a story about the costs of keeping things hidden in shame and silence - yet ultimately it is about the hope and redemption that are possible when these secrets are acknowledged and claimed. There is a powerful and healing magic when someone speaks their own truth, and realizes that they are not alone.

When everything’s gone, all you have is each other…

An explosion….a cloud….chaos….Louise wakes to find herself in her co-worker Mark’s fallout shelter. They cannot leave, but can they stand to stay together until it’s safe? This fast-paced, claustrophobic work by award-winning playwright Dennis Kelly examines modern society’s fears while exploring the interpersonal dynamics of being trapped together with a person you thought you knew.

After the End has been called “arresting” and said to have “tremendous claustrophobic force” (The Guardian), “a tense-two hander….Kelly’s taut, expletive-ridden script is…an absorbing and sharply delivered exploration of human behavior, pushed to extremes” (The Independent) and “Terrifying… [with] dark political undertones… a quest for power and status that finds expression in a war-seeking, paranoid racism that is all too recognisable in every western culture” (The Scotsman).

This is “In-yer-face theatre”. Adult content, language and situations - appropriate for 18 years and older only.

DENNIS KELLY’s work for stage includes Debris, Osama the Hero (2006 Meyer-Whitworth Award winner), Love and Money (Olivier Award nominee), Taking Care of Baby (2007 John Whiting Award winner, TMA Best New Play nominee), Orphans (2009 Edinburgh Fringe awards Fringe First and Herald Angel winner), and Matilda the Musical (Best Musical 2011 from the TMA Award, London Theatre Award, Critics’ Circle Theatre Award and Evening Standard, as well as the 2012 Olivier and the 2013 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical). His television work includes the BAFTA-nominated Pulling and the series Utopia for Channel 4. He has also written for film and radio, including the 2004 work The Colony, which won the Radio & Music Award for Best Scripting for Broadcast and the Prix Europa for Best European Radio Drama of the Year.

KAREL HEŘMÁNEK, JR. has appeared in over 20 television programmes and movies (including Gympl s (r)ucením omezeným, Cesty domů, Ordinace v ruzové zahrade 2, Všechny moje lásky, Polda, Zločin v Polné and a guest spot on National Geographic’s Genius) and films (including Anthropoid, The Beauty Inside and the upcoming films Capio and Journey to China: The Mystery of the Iron Mask). He has done extensive work in Prague theatre, working for both Czech- and English-language companies, including Divadlo Bez zábradlí (Yes, Prime Minister and Much Ado About Nothing) and Prague Shakespeare Company (Tweltfth Night, The Winter’s Tale, The Order of the Blue Chrysanthemum). He splits his time between Prague and New York City.

VICTORIA HOGAN, a Los Angeles native, trained at The London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art and The Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, as well as with The Groundlings in Los Angeles. She’s had done stage work both in America and the Czech Republic, appearing in Los Angeles in Sisters at the Walt Disney Music Hall, Jon Braver’s interactive horror play Delusion and Theatre Asylum’s Pulp Shakespeare. In Prague, where she now lives, she has worked extensively with Blood Love and Rhetoric (including The Great Gatsby), Prague Shakespeare Company (including Man of La Mancha), Alabaster Cat (including M4M and All in the Timing), and other Prague-based English-language theatre companies. She also does commercial, voiceover and television work, including Sky TV’s Britannia, a guest spot on National Geographic’s Genius and a stint on Comedy Central’s Nathan For You.

It's back for two nights only - the madcap show that has been called ""breathlessly inventive: (Washington Post), ""an absolute resolute hoot of a bawdy comedy of errors"" (Broadway World) and a ""glorious ray of sunshine"" (DC Metro).

An ancient manuscript has been found in a parking lot in Leicester, England (alongside an unimportant-looking pile of bones that got tossed in a dumpster). This 425-year old text turns out to be the literary Holy Grail: William Shakespeare’s Long Lost First Play (abridged) puts many of Shakespeare’s most famous lines into surprising and comic contexts.

In this strange-yet-familiar narrative, an ancient grudge pits Puck (from Midsummer) against Ariel (from The Tempest) and turns Shakespeare’s canon upside-down, creating such strange bedfellows as Hamlet and that master motivator Lady Macbeth, Viola and Richard III, King Lear and the Weird Sisters, and (of course) Dromio and Juliet. Using questionable scholarship and street-performer smarts, playwrights Reed Martinand Austin Tichenor weave together most of the famous speeches and plot devices of Shakespeare’s thirty-nine plays to create a fast, funny, and fictional fortieth, filled with witty wordplay and vaudevillian variety.

“Long Lost” received its first workshop production at Shakespeare Napa Valley under the artistic leadership of Jennifer King and now makes her directorial debut at Prague Shakespeare Company with the European premiere of this very funny play.","['Contemporary', 'New Work']",['Czechia'],['English']

ALL IN THE TIMING – An Evening of Mini-Plays by David Ives
Directed by Derek DeWitt & Debbie Wilson DeWitt

Starring: Sam Barlien, Darren Copeland, Kraig Darnell, Mark Fitzhenry, Victoria Hogan, Jeff Koch, Sinéad Phelps and Fanette Ronjat

March 23-25 at 19:00 (7:00 pm) @ Divadlo Kolowrat

“One of the zestier plates of theatrical tapas to be had.” - New York Times

Venus in Fur playwright David Ives is a very funny man, and in the 1990s wrote a series of short comedic plays, which are often performed together in an evening called All in the Timing (nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Best Play and winner of the Outer Critics Circle John Gassner Playwriting Award). These are the most performed plays in the USA after Shakespeare. And now they come to Prague.

Seven carefully curated plays explore how language defines and limits us, yet can be used to bridge the spaces between us. It’s a fast-paced comedy feast that makes you laugh while making you think. You’ll see:

• Chimpanzees attempting to write Hamlet
• Boy meets girl, again and again, and again
• A lesson in hidden social meanings in English
• Philip Glass buying a loaf of bread
• A man trapped in a city of the mind
• A woman finding her true voice through an artificial language
• How miniature golf can be like classical music

Plus live musical interludes. All in 90 minutes. It’s a quick, provocative evening with something for everyone. Includes two Czech Republic premieres.

Performed in English

PSC Artistic Director Guy Roberts says “This is Shakespeare’s sexual harassment play.” It’s also one of the Bard’s “problem plays” – shifting between dark psychological drama and obvious comedy. To highlight some of these issues, Prague Shakespeare Company and Alabaster Cat - A Creative House are bringing back one of the most talked about productions of last year's PSC400, for two night only. Steve Josephson steps in as the Duke and Producer.

Written in 1603, William Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure is a tale of sex and morality, lies and hypocrisy, justice and mercy. It’s also about powerlessness, and the abuse of power. The autocratic ruler of the city tells a young woman she must surrender her virginity to save her brother’s life.

In M4M – A Play on Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure, we watch actor hopefuls as they audition for a production of the play, and then shift to an early rehearsal, where discussion and discord arise as the cast and crew grapple with their own attitudes towards women, power and justice. 

Over 400 years later, just how much progress has been made? Is our modern world a fairer place, or is it still the same old story?

Performed in English with no surtitles. At Divadlo Kolowrat.

Now in its Guinness World Record-setting 53rd season at The Charlottetown Festival, the original *Anne* musical is an adaptation of the beloved story of an imaginative red-haired orphan searching for belonging, and is guaranteed to tug at heartstrings and tickle funny bones.  

The idea for the musical version of the book came about when the Campbells (Norman and Elaine) visited Don Harron, and he gave them the book *Anne of Green Gables*, suggesting that it would make a musical. The three prepared a musical version, which was broadcast in 1956 on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a television movie.

*Anne of Green Gables-The Musical™* has played to audiences in Japan, London and New York. It has been translated into Japanese and Swedish.

Tumaini Festival was founded in 2014. It is an extraordinary example of a large-scale cultural event within a refugee camp, created and run by refugees in collaboration with the host community, for the benefit of both communities. Across the three previous editions over 14,000 people attended the event, and 86 acts from across Malawi, Africa and the world shared the same stages with performers from Dzaleka. Tumaini Festival so far united 10 nationalities of performers: DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Belgium, UK, Italy and South Korea.

The festival gained national and international media coverage. It has so far achieved a media reach estimated at 40,000,000 people worldwide, presenting a genuinely different and positive story about refugees.

Tumaini Festival represents a unique opportunity for refugees to share aspects of their lives with interested visitors, to exhibit and sell their crafts and to feel the hope of connecting to a wider community. Tumaini Festival has become a community celebration that residents of Dzaleka appreciate as their own event, which they are looking forward to and want to see happen regularly.

In Buenos Aires it’s called ‘mufa’, in Moscow there’s ‘toska’, ‘blues’ in Memphis, ‘hiraeth’ in Wales, ‘mestizia’ in Turin – but it is Portugal and Turkey where the feeling is particularly prevalent. When the Portuguese director Pedro Penim moved to Istanbul two years ago, he was struck by that mood and immediately felt at home – and inspired to write about the similarity. Whether in the ennui of Alexandria, the ghostliness of Prague, the glumness of Glasgow, the dispiritedness of Boston, that sentiment of Lisbon and Istanbul is found in most places where a glorious past is yearned for – and where tensions of the present can be explained by delving into history and searching for answers.

Directed by Cassie Tunick

Monday June 9th at 7:00pm 

BURNING is a highly kinetic, semi-comic romp through the absurd landscapes of climate change where comedy, tragedy, activism and cautious optimism collide.

Using movement, song, monologue and otherworldly images — this solo play pings between Hurricane Sandy, our obsession with apocalyptic movies, NPR’s narcoleptic effect, and the million trivial tasks that preoccupy us while Rome burns. Faced with a winnowing polar ice cap and obdurate political leaders, BURNING asks the uncomfortable question: If we can’t Google, Tweet, Skype or buy our way out of this particular fix, what happens next?

Ultimately, BURNING invites audiences to climb into fraying hammock and drift down into a dream deep enough, perhaps, to re-envision the way people inhabit the planet.

A reception will follow the performance with wine available for a small donation.

Helen Bastion is 74 years old, but age has not taken its toll on this matriarch's will or her need to control her family, from her compliant husband David to her resentful daughter Barb. But when she begins to suffer lapses of memory, her steely facade begins to crumble. Words lose their meaning and reality fragments, as Helen's own sense of self starts to dissolve. Is she truly disappearing, or is she becoming something greater? An excitingly theatrical and surprising play about aging, power, grace, and imagination.

Dangerous Ground
February 14 – March 10, 2013

Written by Jacques Rivette and Marilù Parolini

Conceived, designed and directed by Doris Mirescu

L’AMOUR FOU is a multimedia art-installation/performance event based on Jacques Rivette’s 1969 film L’Amour Fou.  Images, memory, time and dream. Actors are rehearsing a 17th century play. A marriage is ending… The parallel between art and life creates an intrinsically complex narrative where elements of theatre and film interact as reality slowly decomposes and reveals that fiction might just be what is true, after all.

An intricate set-up of live video feed and projections create an environmental theatrical experience that deconstructs perception. A complex layering involving film and theater language searches for new forms of storytelling and ways of portraying intimacy. After their adaptation of Céline and Julie Go Boating performed last July in a storefront in Bushwick as part of the 2012 undergroundzero festival, the members of Dangerous Ground and director Doris Mirescu continue their exploration of French filmmaker Jacques Rivette’s world. Theatre and film mix in an ever-challenging multilayered self- reflexive reality/non-reality. L’Amour Fou is the first segment of a Jacques Rivette trilogy presented by the Brick Theater. Followed by Céline and Julie go Boating and ending with Rivette’s 1971 12 hour long masterpiece, Out 1, 3 by Rivette is a year long epic multimedia adventure that experiments with time, decomposition, politics, love, poetry and the longing for revolution.

“Designer/Director, Doris Mirescu, creates a unique live action/multimedia experience that blurs the lines between live theater, video, and real life. Throughout the entire play all the actors are radio-miked and filmed by 2 cameras, which are projected upon 3 large screens. The set, literally a Brooklyn storefront, is a character in itself. When actors exit the main space they are followed by video cameras as they act out their scenes to the backdrop of the unsuspecting passing public. Other rooms of the building are used including the back yard, basement and toilet. “(olivejuicemusic.com, July 2011)

“the unique use of space, compelling acting and multimedia “parallel action” makes this show an extremely unique, must see, theatrical experience!” (olivejuicemusic.com, July 2011)

“The upside of seeing From Dawn Till Night is the abundant evidence of Mirescu's visionary take on how theatre and other media can be made to intersect, collide, and coalesce, in ways more interesting than are usually offered.” (Review of From Dawn till Night, Martin Denton, nytheatre.com, July 23, 2010)

“I found 3! engaging, disturbing, shocking, relevant, and enigmatic. It is a theatrical experience unlike any other. Because of its unconventional format, its engaging stories, and striking performances, I see myself thinking about it for years to come.” (Review of 3!, E. Michael Lockley, NY Theatre.com July 22, 2009.)

They worked hard through high school to get good grades, high SAT scores and acceptance into the college of their dreams, only to find that the cost of the higher education was drowning them. Although they received some financial aid through scholarships and aid, many were forced to accept student loans to continue pursuing the American Dream. With interest rates hovering around 5-8% and the requirement to start paying them off as soon as you are out of college and working, the mountain of debt young Americans are facing is huge. College costs are sitting between $30,000 - $70,000 a year. After four years of student loans, young Americans are leaving college hundred of thousands of dollars in debt (some quote the national average at $160,000 of debt).

Financial Slavery is a piece examining the different sides of the issue. The costs of education, from hiring qualified professors to text books. The loan system itself and what Congress’ role is in the interest rates. To humanizing the story by looking at different young people in college who are paying these tuition rates. Who pays for the American Dream? Mom and Dad? Student Loans? Scholarships? All sides of the story will be explored through theatre, spoken word, dance and music. The author is a recent college graduate and a member of SOS for over seven years. Alyea Pierce was a finalist in the New York Poetry Slam Competition at Madison Square Garden. A gifted artist and published poet, she has been working throughout the tri-state area helping others find their voice and gain their “Write to Speak”.",,,

Get Away From Me I Love You is queer goodbye performance collage full of dance, pop music, lip sync, borrowed poetry, and transposed images. Hendrix’s kaleidoscopic story-telling weaves itself into a night of leaving and longing; what it means to collide and connect, explode and escape; how we hope for transformation while we cling to what we know; and how important the right Kelly Clarkson song can turn out to be.

The action of “Platonov” is filmed and projected live onto a screen that looms above a conceptual hybrid of affordable (cheap) theatrical architecture while one particular point of view from “Platonov” is broadcast live as a film under the title “The Disinherited.” This conceptually scalable project is experienced as a live performance, as a live-feed, drive-in-movie for an audience in cars, or in bleachers or at the bar, and as a live-broadcast film.",,,

Funny, tender, and ever so tasty. At The Table whisks together a bounty of stories that tackle our sticky love affair with food. Pull up a chair and join us for the world premiere of this provocative new play, an immersive theatrical experience that explores family, food, and the way we eat. As part of the experiential performance, audience members will enjoy a family-style dinner created by chef Sam Ostrow (Block Six). 

In 2006, writer/director Catherine Stewart inherited her grandmother’s collection of cookery books, cut-out recipes, and scribbled notes from the kitchen. From that myriad of memories, Stewart has created a work that explores the complicated world of food production and consumption. The heart of this play captures the joy of wholesome family cooking that warms us all. However, as we delve deeper into the subject of our food, some indigestible truths begin to surface.

With live music composed and performed by Jonny Peiffer (Sojoy) this is an evening at the theatre to engage all senses.

Rock, pop, and alt-country combine to tell the story of six unbridled twenty-somethings: a drug dealer, his recovering addict ex-girlfriend, and the neighbor who loves her; plus an indie musician on the brink of stardom, his unfaithful girlfriend, and her desperate one-night stand. As the concert unfolds, the two love triangles cleverly and catastrophically intersect. Stillwater is an angst-filled love letter to a generation rebounding from the economic and cultural shocks of the last 10 years.

Is it possible to know what's really going on in the world when information is manipulated to serve particular interests? Does anyone really care? Delving into the politics of information, the company—in its singular signature style—conducted extensive interviews with subjects ranging from a policymaker at Homeland Security on the verge of a nervous breakdown to a plucky extraterrestrial (channeled by an equally funny human); from every Jessica Lynch in the phone book (who was willing to talk) to soldiers guarding the New York subway with unloaded weapons.

The story follows two outlaws who become unlikely friends after breaking out of jail together. Froggy is a shiftless drifter without a destination. He joins Injun Bill Picote who is singularly focused on finding the man who turned his dead partner’s skin into a pair of shoes. Their adventures force them to the edge of survival. This leads them to become loyal partners in their travels. Although it is a comedy with lovable characters and smart dialogue, it explores the question of friendship, loyalty and connection in a dangerous place and time. It also explores the concept of vengeance, its worth and consequences. This certainly will resonate with audiences who deal with the ever-shifting frontiers of the 21st Century on a daily basis.",,,

Maine is distinctive among US states for having a vibrant organic farming community (including the oldest organic farming association, MOFGA, in the US); an abundance of family-owned farms, many going back generations; a nationally recognized local food cuisine which the New York Times says makes Portland “a destination for rigorously local and regularly delicious food.”  We appear to be reversing a decades long decline, in Maine and nationally, in the number of farms, farm acreage, and farming communities.  At the same time, the pressure to develop our open spaces is tangible, with many of the opinion that this development represents our only viable economic option.

A story about the crafting of stories, INDUSTRIOUS ANGELS was conceived by actor/creator Laurie McCants on a visit to Emily Dickinson’s home, where the poet wrote, in secret, the almost 1800 poems that were found after her death.  The story unfolds through puppetry, paper-cutting, music, movement, light and dark, and the weaving together of words.  It is a dance of the hands honoring women’s handiwork:  mending, preserving, ordering, adorning, writing, hiding.",[],,[]

IVES. Set in a high-end hotel room at The Hague, WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA imagines former President George W. Bush on the eve of his trial for international war crimes. Tended to by an inscrutable Dutch butler and an alluring masseuse, the President embarks on a long night of drinking, joking, and ruminating, taking the audience through a deep exploration of how we regard our leaders - loving them, fearing them, unintentionally deifying them. WHEN WE GO UPON THE SEA examines an American populace that has grown strikingly complacent in the wake of extraordinary global challenges, exposing one of the world’s most intriguing and influential conflicts: the battle between the elected leader of the free world and a democracy of millions.

But in doing that you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes.”
~Joseph Campbell

This season, Whistler in the Dark has been exploring the idea of the hero - both classical and modern. Using Joseph Campbell's writing as our launching point, we've been exploring what the idea of the vital human means to us, and how we can see ourselves as the heroes in our own lives.

Now we are opening up that exploration to some of our favorite local writers. Using the above quote as a prompt, we are asking a variety of local essayists, poets and short story writers to explore their own relation to the hero's journey. Then, starting in April, the Whistlers will set about creating a stage piece out of the texts that writers develop.",,,

Not just “another” Medea, this provocative, minimalist meta-monodrama is an examination of the use and prevalence of myth in our lives as well as the dangers in becoming too immersed in a role. Marcus’ story is the story of the ultimate outsider and is at once ancient and up-to-the-minute contemporary. Inspired by true events and the work of Euripides, Tom Hewitt plays Marcus and various others in what writer/director Aaron Mark describes as “Grand Guignol horror in the style of Spalding Gray”. The battle between Medea and Jason has been told and retold, adapted and reimagined time after time after time, but never quite like this.

A love triangle featuring the famous outlaw Cisco the Kid, his sweetheart Tonia, a beautiful, intelligent woman of Mexican-Basque descent, and Texas Ranger Lieutenat Sandridge personifies the cultural divisions and menace of the times -- and our own.

Their flirtatious, digging questions and taunts, not to mention mounting sexual tension, culminate in two startling confessions, prompting Julie to make a bold, controversial decision.

Inspired by Strindberg’s Miss Julie, Bees and Lions is also about the fall of a woman—but this time when said woman falls, she takes everyone with her—some willingly–in the name of her cause. Who will be the first to get back up?",,,

The play received readings at SCR’s Pacific Playwrights Festival in April 2012 and as part of Magic Theatre’s new play development “Magic @ the Costume Shop” program. Made possible in part by the National New Play Network’s Continued Life of New Plays Fund, this is the first production of the Rolling World Premiere of I and You, which will also receive productions during the 2013-14 season at the Olney Theatre Center in Olney, Maryland, from February 26 to March 23, 2014, and Phoenix Theatre in Indianapolis, Indiana, from March 13 to April 14, 2014.

She is ninety-nine years old when a freelance journalist attempts to break her silence and coax the “truth” from her about that fateful time so long ago.

On September 13, 1916, in Erwin, Tennessee, they hung Mary by the neck ‘til she died.  She had killed a man, his head splattered along the street in Kingsport.  

Mary’s execution was a media event.  

Mary’s execution was long and drawn out.  

Mary was an elephant with the Sparks World Famous Circus.

At the same time, WILLA FAY, a young African American girl living the best she knows how, finds herself on a parallel path with the infamous Murderous Mary as she struggles against the growing lust of a predator in this seemingly quiet town.

In the hills of Tennessee, the art of storytelling is as rich and alive as it was back in the early days.  A TENNESSEE WALK uses this art, where truth and fiction blend together with no more effort than the drawing in of a breath, and weaves a dark Southern Gothic tale surrounding the legend of Murderous Mary and the effect that secrets have on an impressionable girl of twelve.

Archival historical recordings, old Tennessee folk songs, porches and rockers where tales unfold on firefly-filled nights and the layering of the past and present so that the lines are sometimes clear and sometimes blurred all come together to reveal a mystery that has laid in waiting for close to one hundred years for its chance to be told truthfully and to be told with care.

Murphy’s play views the participants of The Oresteia from Cly's point of view: her long-gone warrior husband Aggie, her replacement companion Aeg, the ghost of Cly (and Aggie’s) murdered daughter Iphy, Cly’s half-sister and sister-in-law Helen, and Aggie’s new riddle-spewing “employee” Cass. To Hades plays out the familiar tale of warfare, blood sacrifice, and even bloodier vengeance, while beleaguered servants try to keep it all together.

*The Highest Step in the World* is a new solo performance that integrates video projection and flying technology in a mythology about the necessity of risk. The play weaves together three storylines--the true story of Air Force Captain Joseph Kittinger, who skydived to earth from the edge of space on August 16, 1960, the true story of Vesna Vulovic, the Serbian airline stewardess who fell 33,000 and survived after the plane she was on was bombed, and the mythical story of Icarus and his loving father Daedalus. You know how that one goes.

Directed by Tara Branham
The audience has arrived at the theatre to see a show about the Chicago slaughterhouses – only to find that the play has been canceled. Instead, the writer is there to give a slideshow presentation about the history of the stockyards. In trying to explore her family’s Polish identity and the exploitation of stockyard workers, the writer unintentionally exposes a trauma from her own past. Inspired by Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle, ANOTHER JUNGLE explores the misuse of power, the way narratives get co-opted, and the way identity accretes over the course of generations.
​
Another Jungle will be presented at The Buena at Pride Arts Center. It is a co-production with The Syndicate.
​
Another Jungle was developed with support from the Playwrights' Center Jerome Fellowship Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Atlanta History Center

130 West Paces Ferry Rd NW, Atlanta, GA 30305

January 13 – February 4, 2018

By Natasha Trethewey

Directed by Susan V. Booth

NATIVE GUARD, the Pulitzer Prize winning collection of poetry by former U.S. Poet Laureate Natasha Trethewey, will be staged this season at the Atlanta History Center, just steps away from its extraordinary Civil War collection.  First adapted for the stage by the Alliance in 2014 to sold-out audiences, NATIVE GUARD juxtaposes the deeply personal experiences of Trethewey, a child of a then illegal marriage between her African-American mother and Caucasian father living in 1960s Mississippi, with the experience of a soldier in the Native Guard, the first African-American Union troop in the Civil War who was charged with guarding white Confederate captives.  Years after her mother’s tragic death, Trethewey reclaims her memory, just as she reclaims the voices of the black soldiers whose service has been all but forgotten.  For tickets and information, call 404.733.5000 or visit www.alliancetheatre.org/nativeguard.

Fondakowski's project is based on the collection in the Library of Congress of over 1,000 unpublished letters, written by Cushman to Emma Crow, the transcription of which has been a ten-year labor of love by scholar Lisa Merrill.

A man sits alone in a cage, starving himself for your entertainment. Sinking Ship's unique, visually-striking adaptation of the Franz Kafka short story uses physical theater, Victorian miniatures, puppetry, and a set of simple props to support a powerhouse solo performance.

Once cheered by thousands, the Hunger Artist is now forgotten by everyone except his one-time manager. What begins as a simple nostalgic story transforms into a startlingly inventive, darkly comic trip into the nature of memory, art, performance, and spectatorship, as told by the only person who remembers an artist whose act was simply... to hunger.

Inspired by homiletics, and the ‘bearing up’ of preachers by congregants, this cosmic-comic performance and sound exploration runs by turns, cold and flaming hot as humans a step from despair or wonder reckon with chance, register their vulnerability in the hands of others, and discover warmth from simple acts of acknowledgement.

5877c0dd17334f313edb65ab,Killer Quack,"[{'_id': '5877b4ed17334f313edb489c', 'name': 'James Judd'}]","A true New York City crime story. Dean Faiello was posing as an Upper East Side doctor at his Skin Ovations clinic and living the high life until one of his patients was discovered buried in his garage. An international manhunt followed the suave con artist to Costa Rica, where he was apprehended and eventually brought back to New York to face justice. The New York Post called him The Killer Quack and splashed his sordid tale of drugs, sex and death across its headlines for months.  James Judd was just another victim who had been mesmerized by the devastatingly handsome con artist until early 2012 when he began receiving Faiello’s letters from Attica. Their year long correspondence and eventual reunion is a strange but comically told story about ambition, willful blindness, forgiveness and forging the light of friendship in the darkest of places and proof that truth is always stranger than fiction.

We really are launching a theatrical event on July 21, 2013. As I write this, June is coming to a close. They say it can’t be done, but we will prove it can. The Spencer-Okoboji Time Bank is already up and running. Gathering a great audience for the play will mean hundreds of people contributing and taking the time and talent of our whole community.

The play itself is a chance to transform the community. Like many places, we have a lot of the discouraged, the unemployed and underutilized, the stuck in a moment, the ones who doubt it can ever change. If you’ve made it to this page, you’ve agreed to take a breath and have an adventure with me. If you’re wondering what’s next for you, I really, really want you to be a part of this production. Have an adventure. Rise to a challenge. I find that in stepping out this way, I attract more opportunities and great energy.

TFOJB is the first in a whole body of work that takes selected saints from The Big Book of Women Saints by Sarah Gallick and brings them to the 21st century. It’s an ensemble piece with slam poetry (think Snap Judgment meets Def Poetry Jam) that presents a challenge to the actors.  

July 21 we will present TFOJB: the Remix. A night of improvisation, innovation and interaction. Also, the lead-up, the performance, and the launch of the Time Bank will be broadcast internationally on Howlround.tv.

So excited! This is theater making a deep investment in the community, setting the stage for the audience to be front and center. Cannot wait to see you there!",,,

Generic Latina 2010 challenges you to confront old stereotypes and face new ones through original music, spoken word, and new autobiographical stories reflecting the diverse lives of these women: from one young woman’s legal battle to change her name, to an intimate portrait of a Brazilian’s first-time wax (you mean to say that Brazilians don’t really wax that way?), to a woman’s surprise discovery that the only internationally-understood reference to her own culture is West Side Story.",[],,[]

Her long-suffering mother finally decides to call a psychologist for guidance, who provides her with the best treatment possible for a young girl with existential blues—she molds her into a pop culture phenomenon.  Hoping to find her place in the world, Ashley adopts the various personas that are given to her—from endearing sitcom star to provocative pop star to serious singer who totally doesn’t care about her looks.  She makes many new friends along the way, including an alarmingly effervescent casting agent, a British music video director who’s all about female empowerment, and a teenage actor who turns out to be more interesting than the generic love interests he plays in every teen sitcom.  As Ashley rides the wave of teen girl pop culture identities, she begins to discover, along with her mother and her psychologist, that the secret to purpose and meaning in the universe might not be able to be found in a Cosmo personality quiz, after all.",,,

We are at a crossroads in the Land of Oz. Twilight. A boy named Tip receives a mysterious prophecy from a dying Queen. Tip's resulting adventure into the unknown is the heart of Bright Now Beyond, a new music theatre piece by Daniel Alexander Jones and Bobby Halvorson, presented by Salvage Vanguard Theater.

Set decades after the events of The Wizard of Oz, this Oz has lost its luster, and faces hardships brought by drought and disillusionment. Bright Now Beyond draws loosely upon L. Frank Baum's second book in the series, The Marvelous Land of Oz. A pumpkin-headed man and a wooden sawhorse are brought to life by a magical powder. General Jinjur leads a bodacious girl army to the Emerald City in revolt against the dusty Scarecrow King. The Tin Woodsman sharpens his axe and prepares to join the battle. Throughout it all, Glinda, the legendary witch, searches for a lost bit of knowledge to turn a swelling tide, as Mombi, a malevolent sorceress, races to find Tip before he learns a secret so powerful it could change the Land of Oz forever! 

By turns hilarious and poignant, Bright Now Beyond is one part trunk-show and one part ritual of remembrance. The piece explores what might lie beyond the edges of the self and invites us to let go of what we know in order to move down a new path. As the Scarecrow says, ""the journey is the only true thing.""

Relaxed safety standards, nonexistent environmental regulations, and dirt-cheap labor – these are the qualities that attracted Empire Holdings to the island of Marititu. Idealistic Empire negotiator Vi Wells is faced with what seems like an impossible choice: close a land purchase that will destroy the habitat of endangered orangutans, or, procure a tract that’s home to indigenous families -- forcing them to relocate from their ancestral land. 

The play satirizes and subverts several well-worn tropes, including unrequited love, “white savior” complex, and the notion that “women don’t know how to negotiate,” popularized in Sheryl Sandberg’s book, Lean In. Against a backdrop of larger issues, the play looks at Vi’s dilemmas: being forced to choose between her personal ethics and the interests of her employer, and navigating a workplace freighted with gender bias.

Living it up in Kofifi-style 

Despite the violence and poverty, Sophiatown was a legendary black cultural hub and the epicentre of politics, jazz and blues. It symbolised a society that allowed a freedom of action, association and expression, where people lived together in harmony, undivided by race or colour.  The very existence of Sophiatown as a ‘mixed’ suburb was in direct contradiction to the apartheid policy of geographically separating people according to their colour. Its heyday finally ended when the authorities deliberately tore the area apart.

The life and vibrancy of old-style Sophiatown is about to be rekindled, as this classic musical returns to the stage to help the iconic Market Theatre celebrate its 40th anniversary.

Sophiatown is a lively and memorable musical, which is being revived with a new, young cast under the experienced eye of director Malcolm Purkey to delight today’s audiences with its timeless music.

These appointed scapegoats could then be cursed, marginalized, denied existence, tortured, burned, and killed, or conversely sanctified, canonized, and worshiped. They are the products of a culture nourished by binaries of good and bad, the mirror of collective intelligence, the transfigurations that diverge and transcend the individual.

Synopsis:
There is a child. Omnipresently absent.
There is a musician. Pulling the strings.
The setting is a shelter, which is a brothel, which is a theatre: a stage and dressing room.
Or perhaps it is simply the projection of the intimacy between three performers backstage.
Their roles are constantly changing; we get glimpses of the unpolished reality behind their performances.
We bare witnesses to the very transfigurations that their “audience” do not wish to see.",['Contemporary'],['Lebanon'],['Arabic']

The production touches on pressing issues that societies around the globe are currently facing, from terrorism and religious extremism to climate change and gender equality. The end result is a manifesto of the power of theater to heal a community, as well as an exploration of how to talk about the chaos of a world that has become incomprehensible.","['Devised / Ensemble', 'International', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['France'],['French']

The historic walls of the Wade Thompson Drill Hall form the backdrop for this remarkable production, which employs cameramen prowling amongst the actors to catch close ups of key moments that are projected on massive screens amongst the minimalist set to create scenography that borders on installation art.

Using the screenplay rather than Visconti’s film as a starting point, van Hove traces the disintegration of the wealthy Essenbeck family and their steel dynasty during the seizure of power of the Nazis in 1933 in Germany, reflecting the ideological debauchery of a society ready to make the most venomous alliances for the benefit of its sole economic interests. This sharply drawn familial chronicle combines intrigue and ambition with betrayal and murder in the insidious struggle for power, and the corruption of relationships echoes the cruelty and brutality of the political context—themes that have the makings of a great modern tragedy.",['Classical'],['France'],[]

Modeled after the classical Greek tragedy The Oresteia, Fore! traces the struggles of two contemporary families as they attempt to navigate their relationships to war, power, and disenfranchisement.

Amid cultural divisions and social unrest, a transnational theater event seeks to address the urgent question: What makes us a society?  Through a clash of the poetic and the political, Fore! uses investigative theater techniques to interrogate and expose accepted cultural mythologies: What constitutes our sense of belonging to a country? What is meant by the word ‘‘nation?’’ How have the French and Americans built their national narratives? Their mythologies? Where do we stand in a globalized, hyper-connected world in terms of our values, our identities, our democracies?

The play is directed by Arnaud Meunier, Director of La Comédie de Saint-Étienne, and is written by CalArts faculty and alumna Aleshea Harris. Fore! culminates a two-year-long collaboration process which has brought ten CalArts actors and artists together with actors from France.

Fore! will premiere at the La Comédie de Saint-Étienne, National Drama Center in France in February 2018 with additional stops at the Théâtre de la Ville in Paris and The National Theatre in Brussels.

Fore! is created in collaboration with Ecole de la Comédie da Saint-Etienne with support from the FACE Contemporary Theater Fund and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy.","['Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental', 'International', 'New Work', 'Theatre for or by Women', 'Political / Social Engagement']","['United States', 'France']",['English']

Pedro Quinn is well past 40 and still fighting, not only for championships but for the right to be himself, on his own terms. He even has a protege, a young female boxer who reminds him of his own youthful fights in an out of the ring. But when a detached retina threatens to end the only life he knows, and when old frenemies Vinal and Sarita want to make a movie about the champion he killed in the ring 20 years ago, Quinn can no longer hide from the ghosts of his past. Nor can protect those he loves from the specter of hatred, much less the oncoming onslaught of what will soon be named the AIDS virus. He can hide in plain sight no more, and his biggest fight is yet to come.

Daughters of the Revolution is an experiment in creating an experiential understanding of women’s experience of giving birth in Ireland. Working across the artistic disciplines of visual art and theatre performance and interwoven with public engagement and discussion, 4elements will take you on an epic journey through pregnancy, birth and the HSE.

This project is comprised of three strands: A theatre performance, visual arts installation, and an expert panel in discussion with the audience.

Theatre Performance:

Daughters of the Revolution, by Kate Harris, is a satirical and irreverent play, examining exactly what women have to go through to get from pregnancy to birth. And once you go down the rabbit-hole of the maternity services…who knows what could happen. With original music by award winning composer Doc O’Connor.

The play is based on research into women’s experience of maternity carried out by 4elements Theatre Company, in partnership with AIMS Ireland, with the Research and Development grant from CREATE in 2013, and on-going research into the experiences of maternity services from the perspective of midwives with the School of Nursing and Midwifery, TCD.

Art Installation:

Centered on issues of agency and body autonomy as experienced by women in the Irish maternity services, the exhibition investigates the social perceptions around maternity.

The exhibition will include contributions from artists Anne Marie Kilshaw-Visual Arts Director of The Complex, Laura Fitzpatrick, Bronwyn Gaffney, Paul Timon from the Dublin Camera Club, and a text pieces from US artist, Coral Mallow.

Post-Show Panel Discussion:

The panel will bring together experts in the field of maternity and social policy to engage in open and honest dialogue with the audience in a safe, creative space. The conversations are recorded and edited to be uploaded as podcasts to a dedicated SoundCloud account under the title Daughters of Revolution.

The beloved Canadian classic about love, loss, and reconciliation was daringly re-imagined by visionary director Ravi Jain. With its boldly spare staging, this production asks “Can you ever truly return home?”

“With just two actors and only a few physical elements, the audience will be transported to the place of David French’s timeless tale; Newfoundland under a star-filled sky,” explains Jain.

It’s 1926 and every day the villages of Newfoundland are being abandoned by their young for a new life in the big city. But eighteen year-old Jacob Mercer has come home to Coley’s Point, from Toronto, to win back his former sweetheart Mary Snow, who he abruptly left over a year ago. By the light of a moon-filled night, the former lovers meet to confront their past choices and contemplate a possible future together.

“Ravi Jain is one of Canada’s bright lights,” says Artistic Director Jovanni Sy. “I am delighted to showcase this extraordinary director’s work here at Gateway.

A tireless creator, director of dreams and the driving force behind an extraordinary world of theater, Andrés Pérez was one of Chile’s most important twentieth century artists. With an esthetic with popular culture running through it and a strong social conscience, his artistic style and new forms of creation brought new life to the stage. He touched crowds, crossed borders and brought dignity to normally marginalized people, widening theater’s social scope. The aim of Andrés Pérez de Memoria is therefore to highlight and transmit this important creative legacy.

With a nomadic, moving show for large audiences that integrates theater, music and acting, this tribute turns into something full of poetry, memory and humor, just as Pérez would have liked. Only involving artists who worked with him at some point, the show blends biographical fragments with scenes from emblematic plays such as La Negra Ester, Popol Vuh and Nemesio Pelao qué es lo que te ha pasao, among others. In the words of its directors, “It’s both necessary and urgent to mention Andrés Pérez at this historical, social and political point of the country’s history and the fact that his legacy is alive and well. Not only do new artistic generations deserve to know about him, but also the population as a whole”.",[],['Chile'],['Spanish']

Created eight months after the attacks in Paris, Miniatures is, in some ways, an attempt to reconnect with the public in an intimate show and an optimistic take on the world’s problems. “Art helps clarify things, shedding light on the poetic dimension of events, which the public can take control of”, explains director Jean-Luc Courcoult.

In characteristic style, the company’s production involves multiple visual and theatrical elements, where the absurd and the humorous – and also tenderness and reflection – take over on a journey for all ages.

This story about dance is constructed by tackling dance as movement that lives in the spoken word, in gestures and in the body’s memory, in autobiographical elements, in documents and in experiences. Taking the Trío 65 group as a starting point, the play was developed by referencing important choreographers and groups who made their mark on the Chilean scene, including Carmen Beuchat, Patricio Bunster, the La Vitrina Art Collective and the Espiral Dance Center.

Coming together specifically to bring this show to life, Prácticas de Vuelo is the result of collaborative research that explored the relationship between groups and individuals and between academic dance and the subjectivity with which each body interprets it.",['Dance / Movement / Choreography'],['Chile'],['Spanish']

By Alix Sobler

Directed by Kimberly Senior

It is 1939, and Nazi Germany has introduced harsh race laws targeting Jews while taking over large swaths of Central Europe.  Fearing the worst, an American Jewish couple makes an extraordinary decision – to arrange for 50 European children to be given up by their parents and taken to safety in the United States.  Each child must have an American family to house them when they arrive, but willing fosters are hard to find.  As a last desperate measure, the couple endures a tense dinner party with estranged friends from a violent household in the hopes of finding a home for one more child.  A suspenseful story inspired by true events that will leave audiences at the edge of their seats.  Winner of the 2018 Alliance/Kendeda National Graduate Playwright Competition.

There has been extensive research on the life of Daisy Bates with the aid of a number of international academics.

Daisy Bates was born in Co. Tipperary, Ireland in 1859, emigrating to Australia twenty-three years later. She worked as a governess, managed to marry three times without ever divorcing and had one child. However, she is best known for her decision to devote over 40 years of her life studying Aboriginal people – their history, culture, beliefs and customs. Living in a tent in remote settlements from Western Australia to the edge of the Nullarbor Plain, she wrote books, hundreds of academic papers and countless observations on the subject.

Her accounts, among the first attempts at a serious study of Aboriginal culture, were published by anthropological and geographical societies in Australia and overseas.

This project has been supported by Arts Council of Ireland, Australia Council of the Arts, Australian Embassy, Project Arts Centre, Kildare County Council, Dublin UNESCO City of Literature, Riverbank Arts Centre and Irish Theatre Institute.","['Indigenous', 'New Work', 'Physical Theatre', 'Theatre for or by Women']",['Ireland'],['English']

Where do the stories come from? Who shapes them?  How does it all come together? And who is the dramaturg?

Join Dramaturgs Network Ireland for this exploration and presentation on dramaturgy and the making of new performances. Following the explosion of #WakingtheFeminists this event will look at the many and varied methods and aesthetics employed by Irish women in creating new plays.

Dramaturgs Network Ireland are delighted to showcase the work of three highly successful recent productions:

Spinning by Deirdre Kinahan in the Dublin Theatre Festival 2014
the much lauded autobiographical audio installation at the Old Mac Belfast in 2015 Reassembled Slightly Askew written by Shannon Yee
Farm the documentary performance piece created by Sophie Motley with Willfredd Theatre for Dublin Fringe Festival 2012
This distinguished panel of women theatre makers will be in discussion with their production dramaturgs Gavin Kostick (Spinning), Hanna Slattne (Reassembled Slightly Askew) and Dan Colley (Farm).

The panel will reflect on the different stages of the development process from instigation and inspiration through drafting and workshops into the third and final stage of rehearsal and staging. In this we hope to explore the similarities and differences of each dramaturgs practice across three different forms of performance writing. There will be ample opportunity for feedback and questions from the floor about each stage of the development process.

The afternoon will be completed by two short presentations by Hanna Slattne and Pamela McQueen, co-chairs of the Dramaturgs Network Ireland. These will consider the wider potentials of dramaturgical practice in Ireland by reflecting on Hanna’s work on the Joint Sectoral Dramaturgy Project in Northern Ireland and Pamela’s work as an in house dramaturg working on programme development in the Tron Theatre, Glasgow.

Dream deferred is both instructional and mesmerizing. It’s a must-see show for anyone who cares about Detroit and its history. Although the subject matter is not appropriate for young children, mature teens and sentient adults cannot help but benefit from experiencing this production and the integrity with which it presents a dark chapter in our past. The perspectives are diverse, but the lesson is clear. When we treat groups of people as “others” – when we encourage anger, hate and resentment – we fuel social combustion. When we listen to each other’s stories, as we do in this compelling Matrix Theatre production, we are reminded of how much we have in common.

Will they forge ahead, or be compelled to repeat the patterns of the past? “Katherine” is a moving testament to the grit, endurance, and humor of five remarkable women.

""Shifting accents, eras, and personalities in moments, and somehow making it look effortless, Beckwith navigates a broad expanse of emotional terrain, using her wide, expressive eyes to land a joke, or convey disdain, love, desperation, wonder, or pain. She wrings every comic opportunity from Carney’s script, and thanks to Wolber’s thoughtful blocking, beckwith’s stage movements feel natural while preventing the play from becoming visually static."" - Jenn McKee, encoremichigan.com

Whether you are saying it to a person, an addiction or a place, every aspect of your life that you part ways with is acknowledged by that final farewell: “ok, bye”.

As a company we describe our style as theatrical tapas, because we take the best of everything we find and use it to make intimate, involving theatre: tales from our own lives, writing, improvisation, music and movement.","['Contemporary', 'Devised / Ensemble', 'Documentary', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'Physical Theatre', 'Theatre for or by Women']",['United Kingdom'],['English']

Friday 2 February 2018, 7pm
Tickets: £12 | £10 Concessions | School Tickets available (please contact the Box office for details)

‘I Had a Black Dog’ is a comic; fun and heart wrenching story about one man, (a representative for all of us,) in his struggle with depression and the various different forms in which it reveals itself to us. ‘I Had a Black Dog’ is for anyone who has ever suffered with or knows someone who has suffered with some form of depression or anxiety. A beautiful and heart warming story.

The adaptation of the international best selling book tells the story of Joe’s depression which is personified in the shape of a black dog.

His dog is his constant companion, whether sitting obediently in the corner or leaping on his chest in the night, he is always there. Can the dog be trained to behave so that Joe can maintain his job and relationships? Can he tame the beast?

Audiences who came to see this first run of the show in 2015 said things like:

“I found myself laughing out loud and recognised a little thought that said: You shouldn’t be laughing, this is serious, you’re being inappropriate! I told that voice to shut up, I’m enjoying myself.”

Now more than ever, it’s important for women to tell our stories and make our voices heard. NOplays is proud to present: HERSTORY 3: JOURNEY WOMEN, two evenings of new plays celebrating the strength and bravery of unsung heroines.

 

About the Project:

 

HERSTORY 3: JOURNEY WOMEN; is NOplays third HERSTORY Festival. The goal of this project is to continue shedding a light on the untold stories of women in our country, both in our history, and on our stages. HERSTORY 3 features the stories of two sisters attempting to reconnect with their late grandmother, a painter exploring her sexuality, a saint fighting for the recognition she deserves, and an activist on a quest to restore hope for herself and her country. All of these women, from all parts of the globe, are on a journey to discover their true selves and embrace their destinies.

 

The plays featured in HERSTORY are part of 365 Women a Year. This international playwriting coalition involves over 200 women across the world who have signed on to write one or more one-acts about extraordinary women in history. The project’s ambitious yet focused goal is to write women back into the social consciousness as well as empower and promote female playwrights, and plant seeds of herstory around the country.

 

HERSTORY will take place at the Institute Library in New Haven, CT, March 9th and 10th at 7pm. Plays include We-Remember written by Amy Oestricher and directed by Ingrid Oslund, Frida Kahlo: Heartbreaker written by Lylanne Musselman and directed by Teresa Langston, The Astonishing and the Lily written by Kendra Augustin and directed by Keith Paul, and The Legend of Sigridur Tomasdottir written by Natalie Osborne and directed by Moira Malone. There will be a raffle with gift cards to local business and other fabulous prizes. Refreshments will be served free of charge. There is a $10 suggested donation for entry. Tickets are available at the door or at https://institutelibrary.z2systems.com/np/clients/institutelibrary/event.jsp?event=1203

We hope to see you there!

After interviewing neuroscientists, sociologists, addiction experts, and therapists, British writer and performer Christopher Green presents an immersive theater experience inviting audiences to attend a fictional self-help group that takes a playful look at how sex and pornography are consumed. Questioning the side effects of porn consumption, Green asks audiences to consider if society is in the grip of an actual addiction or a moral panic, through increasingly distorting layers of reality and theatricality. Expect witty observations, surprises, and more than a few laughs. Casting to be announced.
 
""[Prurience] tests the limits of theatre... at its fiendish, exhilarating best it makes you question not just attitudes to porn but how we experience reality."" - The Guardian (UK)
 
""Theatrically the piece is audacious, springing a series of head-spinning surprises.  This is the kind of art that leaves its mark on you.  Unnerving, and uncomfortably compelling."" - The Times (UK)
 
""Green and company confound us, drawing profound attention to the warped notions of pleasure, pain and privacy that are peddled by contemporary pornography."" - The Stage (UK)

""Prurience will leave you guessing and thinking long after you've left the theatre.""
- Spy In The Stalls (UK)
 
Prurience has been created with support from the Wellcome Trust.

Blurring the boundaries between action and narration, the direct and indirect discourse, the performers take turns representing the vague anxiety of a wealthy couple, who are about to buy an condominium in a newly built high-rise. By teasing out the barely visible realities of class divide in today's Japan, the play interrogates the contemporary meaning of ""happiness."" The script makes a fairly minimal use of simple language while the performers reject a facile recourse to conventionalized bodily representation.

Primeira montagem no Brasil de um texto do autor japonês Toshiki Okada (1973-), Nós, os Outros Ilesos retrata as apreensões de um casal de classe média que está prestes a se mudar para um arranha-céu recém-construído, às vésperas de uma importante eleição. Um marido, uma esposa, uma amiga, um homem desconhecido e outro ferido. Personagens sem muito contorno, que fazem emergir questões fundamentais em nossos dias, como o imperativo da ideia de felicidade, o medo diante do desconhecido, a precariedade das relações sociais e a ansiedade em relação ao futuro. Na peça dirigida por Carolina Mendonça, as ações são mais descritas que realizadas, proporcionando uma proximidade com o público que se traduz também no uso do espaço. O espetáculo propõe uma experiência de imersão em um ambiente no qual todos estamos juntos, questionando quem somos nós e quem são os outros.","['Immersive', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary']",['Japan'],['Portuguese']

O livro relata o caso de uma jovem que é emparedada viva em seu próprio quarto, a mando do pai, para preservar a honra e encobrir a vergonha familiar. Eliana de Santana inspira-se no ambiente de mistério que envolve a obra. Velas iluminam todo o espaço. Há um corpo e uma parede, um corpo murado. A plateia recebe um copo de água ao entrar no espaço e é convidada a “beber a morta”. A personagem emparedada dança. Uma música fala de amor. Silêncio. A personagem ainda dança. Outra voz canta o amor. Há uma aparição e depois um fim. Apagam-se as velas.

Embora o romance retrate com vivacidade os costumes da sociedade recifense do final do século XIX, é o seu desfecho macabro, o relato do emparedamento, que ajuda a criar esta lenda urbana. A assombração da Emparedada ainda ronda o Recife Antigo. Até hoje, fala-se da presença da morta, contam-se histórias sobre ruídos estranhos e gemidos na casa da rua Nova. Essas histórias, contadas de geração em geração, inspiram este trabalho, que trata de violências, lembranças, aparições, presenças momentâneas, espectros e fantasmas.

This house, which over 60 years later will go up in flames, is a place where three generations of the upper-class Kerkmans meet each other, argue, talk, love and celebrate; a place in which the decisive moments and crises of the family take place. In scenes which jump back and forth in time and assemble in a mosaic-like way, we observe the conversations and interactions of the family members and follow the effects that the crimes and abuses of the grandparents and parents – as well as their suppression and cover-up – have on their children and grandchildren. Although the total transparency of the walls seems to leave no dark places to hide unpleasant truths, a dark family secret is carried on from generation to generation, in plain sight. The desire to look away, the silent group dynamic of forgetting and obliterating is more powerful than that which is apparent.

»Ibsen Huis« is a family epic, a portrait of an era and a rewriting of Ibsen’s family dramas. Simon Stone’s production makes use of Ibsen-like family constellations and characters – the young, idealistic dreamer; the bankrupt industrialist fighting for his legacy; the wife who is stronger than her husband and searches for the meaning of life; the couple whose relationship dissolves in a chaos of sex, death and mutual recrimination – and from them creates a new, distinct drama about the impossibility of repression and the struggle with one’s own memory.","['Experimental', 'International', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['Netherlands'],['Dutch']

He breaks off the rehearsals and takes himself off by taxi through contemporary Athens in search of a subject for his play and for his deceased friend. On this journey, which is a descent like Orpheus’ into the realm between life and death, Wahid keeps finding traces of Sophocles’ Philoctetes. In a liminal world constantly switching between cinematic phantasmagoria and his own physical presence as an actor, Mouawad researches forgetting in the contemporary world and uncovers the tragedy of a country. Greece reveals itself to him as being marked by devastation, the debt crisis and EU austerity measures. He encounters young people whose sense of hopelessness makes them anaesthetise themselves in Athens’ nightlife and commit suicide. For him, the trip into the realm of the dead becomes a journey of remembering during which those who, like Philoctetes, have passed from being forgotten to annihilation, momentarily register anew in the collective memory – and in doing so also bring the injustice caused by politics in today’s Greece emphatically to light.","['International', 'Monologue / Solo Performance', 'New Work']","['France', 'Canada', 'Lebanon']",['French']

We should not neglect to prepare for this final ending because without death life would barely have meaning. But when will it come? What follows it? And how does one pursue a fulfilled life up to that point? Five people between the ages of 74 and 94 search for possibilities to come to terms with their own deaths. On a theatre stage. Somewhere between performance, drama and biographical narration, they talk about their personal fears, wishes and hopes, sing songs from their youth and play out contrasting variations of dying. But can you rehearse your own death in the same way that people plan their own funerals? Director Karen Breece spent over a year talking to old people about dying and, out of these conversations, developed a text which is located somewhere between memory and hope, reality and fiction. In »don’t forget to die« actor Ursula Werner and four of her contemporaries explore the funny and tragic sides of life and death.","['Devised / Ensemble', 'New Work']",['Germany'],['German']

Born prematurely, he is a deformed, hobbling, hunchbacked cripple who, on the battlefields of the Wars of the Roses – which flared up after the death of Henry V – served his family and above all his brother, Edward, well. Now Edward is king, thanks to a number of murders carried out on his crippled brother’s own initiative. But the end of war brings Richard no peace. His hatred for the rest of the world, to which he will never belong, lies too deep. And so he does what he does best and kills some more, clearing away every obstacle that lies in his path to becoming king. If fate prevents him from being part of a society of those blessed by good fortune, he will at least lord over them. He plays off his rivals against each other with political cunning, unscrupulously exploits the ambitions of others for his own ends and strides spotless through an immense bloodbath until there is no one left above him and the crown is his. But even this triumph, purchased with the death of enemies, allies and relatives alike, still fails to heal the great insult nature has visited upon him. Alone at the apex of the English kingdom, deprived of all his adversaries, he now turns his rage on his true nemesis – himself.

»Richard III« is one of Shakespeare’s earliest works, first performed around 1593. But until this day the title character has lost none of his fascination. His allure lies first and foremost in his unbridled, single-minded, gleefully exhibited amorality. Richard is the first in a line of Shakespearean villains whose moral autonomy and virtuoso art of manipulation appear to be schooled by Machiavelli’s »The Prince«: Iago in »Othello«, Edmund in »King Lear« and the Lady in »Macbeth«. But the play does not just restrict itself to the demonization of a psychopathic spree-killer. It is also the portrait of a power elite torn asunder by internal strife, out of whose midst a perverse dictator emerges.","['Classical', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['Germany'],['German']

It’s 1965 and everything is just about to happen. Pop, subculture, superstars, feminism, drugs, bright lights, and sex are about to rock the world like never before. Gob Squad take the hand of the King Of Pop himself, Andy Warhol, and take a trip back to the underground cinemas of New York City, back to where it all began.
 
Gob Squad’s Kitchen takes one of Warhol’s films, Kitchen, as its starting point. Nothing much happens in the original film yet it somehow encapsulates the hedonistic experimental energy of the swinging sixties. Learning lines was considered ‘old fashioned’ so the actors just hang around. Sex, drugs and wild parties are referred to but nothing in particular takes place. As Edie Sedgwick, one of the film’s stars, says “I live my part too – only I can’t figure out what my part is in this movie.”
 
Gob Squad set themselves the task of reconstructing Kitchen and other Warhol films Eat, Sleep and Screen Test. How can they get it just right? How do they know if they’re going wrong? How did people dance in 1965? What did they talk about? Had feminism happened? Or was it yet to begin? Gob Squad’s Kitchen becomes a journey back in time and back to the future again.

The residents of a Dublin tenement shelter from the violence that sweeps through the city’s streets. A revolution that will shape the country’s future rages around them. What kind of Ireland awaits them?

The Plough and the Stars was first performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1926. The audience rioted. Now regarded as a masterpiece, this provocative play is an essential part of our understanding of 1916.

Located strategically in the center of the living room was the royal fireplace of the royal apartment. And next to her, a small table where someone had left a package of junk food. On the right side and also in the background was another door that separated the bathroom, and a second room, from the room. In that space of the home specifically intended for socialization, a giant wooden doll rested. In short, the scenario could be the living room of any of us. Nowadays, it is not strange to find plays that happen in spaces that do not have to be transformed into fictitious places, as happens in the big buildings destined to the theatrical representation and, for example, a stage like the Teatro Colón has to pass through a forest. When the theater takes place in places that do not need to pass for another, there is an effect of reality that enhances the theatrical experience. In that real space, an apartment representing itself, the story of Clara, Max, Lola and Samuel, characters between 20 and 30 years that by chance chance spend a night together. The action begins with the exposure of the relationship, somewhat conflictive, between some roommates who have characters so opposite that they have not known how to coexist without generating, for their habits and customs, discomforts in the other. Do you sound familiar? Max and Lola agreed, at a certain point in the past, to rent one of the two rooms that the apartment has through a platform like Airbnb to earn extra money. The matter is complicated because Samuel, a young traveler who comes from Argentina, arrives at the apartment precisely on the same night that Lola, a close friend of Max, goes in search of his comrade hiding from loneliness. Once reunited the coexistence is complicated, if two are company and three are multitude, four, they are an ideal pretext for the chaos to break out. The performance of the artistic team is sober and the performance contained, which does not stop surprising given that it is a work that has not shot enough. Its inhabitants elegantly explain the emotional and rational subtext of the characters they represent while enjoying their acting as actors. The fascinating aspect of the inquiry made by this new director with Apto 401 is that he harmoniously interweaves forms and procedures so diverse that they could even be thought incompatible and, on the contrary, are fitted with intelligence. His work meets the famous unity of space and time, makes a review of the real through the dramatic space, the selection of objects and certain physical actions. But it also introduces choreographies that break the illusion of reality generated by space, in those moments when fictional beings experience restlessness. In addition, the figure of a director who is acrisola with that of an actor, in Jeferson Palacio, is complemented by that of a playwright who examines the limit between the narrative and the dramatic in forms of dialogue as different as the colloquium of the descriptions and the internal expressions formulated in first and third person grammatical.

Four dancers, three musicians, two opera singers and one flamenco singer create an explosive interplay of dance and live music. Drawing from the worlds of flamenco, religious singing and lyrical chant, Catedral is a captivating and provocative expression of the traditional flamenco form.

Trailblazing dancer and choreographer Oona Doherty, in collaboration with renowned DJ and composer David Holmes and designer Ciaran Bagnall, presents Hard To Be Soft – A Belfast Prayer. A reflection on their hometown, this four-part dance work is based on the experiences and realities of living in today’s Belfast.

Exploring masculinity, sectarianism, culture, class and sexuality, Doherty abstracts the memories of her youth to create a physical prayer; a celebration of all that we have and an invocation for all that we are missing. This powerful new piece features a unique cast of performers, including nine Hip-Hop dancers from Belfast’s Ajendance Youth Dance Company.

A prodigious talent, Doherty has garnered international attention as one of Europe’s most gifted and promising dance artists, most recently winning the Total Theatre Award for Dance at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and receiving rave reviews for her standout performance in Enda Walsh’s Arlington.

Bloom’s odyssey is a pandemonium of live music, puppets, dancing, clowning, bowler hats and kazoos. It’s Ulysses as you’ve never imagined it before, a superbly theatrical homage to Joyce’s chronicle of Dublin life and the greatest novel of all time. Created by Abbey Theatre Director Graham McLaren, our production is absurd, brilliant and oodles of fun.

‘My ideal audience is people who always wanted to read the book but felt daunted. They may be surprised to find that it remains a book about themselves and people they know. They will not leave knowing everything about Joyce, no more than I’ll ever comprehend the fullness of his vision. But I hope they are sufficiently engaged by the human drama; by Bloom’s subtle triumphs; Molly’s all too human contradictions and Stephen’s isolation on the eve of departure, to again start to read this superb chronicle of our capital city: one of the greatest and truest novels of all time.’ – Dermot Bolger

Michael hasn’t been home in almost twenty years. Having been kicked out of the seminary and exiled from his family home, he found himself in London, by accident rather than design. But now, the death of his mother sees him back in the small town where he grew up. The place that chewed him up and spat him out.

Reunited with his two brothers, their partners and the local clergy, there are questions that want answering and old scores that need laying to rest.

1964, California. A nine year old girl, Pammy, asks the question, “Mommy, did you ever go to bed with anyone besides daddy?” The child’s mother, Gloria, recently divorced and struggling with her new single status, lies “No, honey.” Gloria later wrote in her diary “What was I supposed to say? Of course, dear. Everyone does? Oh shit.”

Gloria’s discomfort with her own sexual desire, her trying to be good but wanting to be bad, became central to the 1965 films Three Approaches to Psychotherapy, also known as The Gloria Films. The films were intended for academic purposes but given a cinema and TV release, betraying the privacy of the patient Gloria.

This is a timely meditation on female desire in a new political context where misogyny is the winning ticket. Things could get messy. Very messy indeed.

Europe has turned its eyes on Kosovo, which unexpectedly finds itself facing an historic opportunity, which must be exploited. But, as always, it comes with a huge challenge. In addition to Kosovo, Serbia also has the chance to enter the EU. People and animals in Kosovo mobilise to meet the standards that Europe has set as a condition of entry, and to do this better and faster than Serbia. The basic EU document that is given to the Kosovar authorities  is called Kosovo and 3,000 easy regulations on the way to Europe.

The Tony Blair Slaughterhouse in Prishtina, from now onward must sell meat which has been quality-controlled. In their effort to meet this condition, the owners of the slaughterhouse make a Kafkian journey through the state bureaucracy, dealing with officials and bureaucrats who are unhelpful and corrupt. They even have to steal a giraffe from the Skopje zoo for the prime minister of Kosovo to eat on his birthday. And while some people in the new country naively commit to this new challenge, the Orwellian world of animals mobilises and wants to exploit this political momentum to set out and articulate their demands for more dignified slaughter.

Written by a kosovar ‘cynic’, this play is a tragicomic panorama of the current Kosovar and European reality. Kosovo's sincere aspiration to join the EU is confronted on the one hand by confusing and ridiculous European regulations and requirements, and on the other hand, by the ruses of bureaucrats who care only about making things 'look okay on paper'.",[],['Kosovo'],['Albanian']

How many times, while watching a performance, we wished we could step in? How many times we got so bored (often due to the lack of meaning) we were tempted to leave the theatre, or at least to express our dissent? And how many times while watching movement we felt like dancing, to experience what we were seeing also with our other senses? But the social habitus fences us in the audience seat, and routes us into subsequent complicated circuits of post-performance speculations, in which we debate about the type of performance, the audience types and the situations in which the work has been programmed.

These power relationships mirror similar but even more complex balances of power that are present in everyday life.

 
I would like to question the nature of the performative device, by going through it together with the audience with a different vision, in which the focus is not on the interpretation of a symbol but on the sharing of an experience. We created small mechanisms, that are sly “traps” in which the audience is guided by the two performers.

These small devices are conceived in such a way that the spectators must intervene, in order for the dramaturgy to carry on, interrupting of modifying the development of the current scene. In order to do this, we have designed a progressive evolution along which, little by little, the audience is guided into an environment of trust, sharing, empathy, establishing the perfect terrain for always more dramatic and invasive interventions. The aesthetics flirt with the cult movie “A clockwork orange”. The orange, the milk, the colour white, the artist's sado-masochistic relationship with the performing arts system and with the audience: these are the underlying elements to the unfolding experiments. And perhaps, by analysing “the mirror”, we can understand better what is the image we are talking about.",['Dance / Movement / Choreography'],,[]

*Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story* is a humorously dark folktale woven together with a high-energy concert.

This Klezmer-folk music-theater hybrid starring genre-bending sensation Ben Caplan is inspired by the true stories of two Jewish Romanian refugees coming to Canada in 1908. It's about how to love after being broken by the horrors of war. It's about refugees who get out before it's too late, and those who get out after it's too late. And it's about looking into the eyes of God.

This one-man live performance fuses the chaotic revelry of a rock concert with the captivating intimacy of theatrical storytelling. The God that Comes tells the story of Greco- Roman god of wine Bacchus (or Dionysus) and uses Euripides’ classic The Bacchae as a primary source. In a world ruled by greed and an oppressive king obsessed with rules and order, the lesser classes have taken to the countryside in a hedonistic spiritual revolution fueled by wine, ritual madness, and ecstasy. Women, slaves, outlaws, and foreigners have all gone to the mountain to worship the god of wine, and to commune with their animal needs to dance, to lose control, to get drunk, and have sex. The king rails against the protesters, leading to a bloody conclusion.

The God that Comes is a tonic for a society that has lost its sense of balance, and for a people that have lost touch with their animal instincts. It is an invitation to raise a glass together, hear a story, and get lost in the music for a few hours.","['Contemporary', 'Monologue / Solo Performance', 'New Work']",['Canada'],['English']

A bold melding of immersive multidisciplinary performance, intimate personal narrative, and theory, Geologic Formations explores the present-unseen: the way socio-political events haunt the individual and collective body.

Curious about her experience of the present-unseen  – invisible chronic illness impacting the (myo)fascia, and the invisibilized intergenerational impacts of war, attempted genocide and displacement, specifically the 1942-43 liquidation of the Białystok Ghetto, Poland – mia susan amir, with collaborators, creates an interactive experience that crosses and collapses time and geography; to talk to ghosts; to decode what shapes our perceptions; to face the limits and possibilities of empathy.

Historically inspired, Geologic Formations is a response to the contemporary rise of fascism.

This ground-breaking work pushes the boundaries of theatre.

As a worthy heir to Scapin, this flamboyant modern servant rejects the models of understanding of this world, our world, which he finds stupefyingly changed by our constant exposure to media. He isn't quite the same himself. He has to learn to reconstruct himself in space, to juggle with modern ideas and with the understanding men and women have of their own time. Nothing can escape the wild flow of his words, full of traps for intelligence, and he seems to be able to find the fun in everything, as comfortable with the idea of transcendence as with his cousin Fatima. Echoing the idea of a play made for an itinerant theatre that addresses its audience directly and with little means, his director says of him: “Ahmed is subversive, he says things as if they were true and laughs at the consequences they have on thought.”","['International', 'Monologue / Solo Performance']",['France'],['French']

It is a simple address, that of Maria Callas at the end of her life, which implicitly comes to paint the picture of an icon, of her loneliness and abandonment in her last years. Created in 2007, 36, Avenue Georges Mandel is also an address to Maria Callas; a way to summon her presence and to remind us of the demanding nature of her art, classical singing, and of the dramatic power of the figures she brought to life—Carmen, Norma, Tosca. To this voice that fills the stage, Raimund Hoghe chooses to respond not with something equally big, but with something little. By subtracting rather than adding, he creates a fragile zone where music can resonate. The ephemeral space he builds using his usual material works here like a go-between: between her and us, between past and present. Between 2007 and 2018. Doing away with gestures and clothes, Raimund Hoghe lets the voice guide and clothe him, and he becomes the ghost of that presence, the better to open a breach between the presence of the bodies and the otherworldliness of a tone.","['International', 'Monologue / Solo Performance', 'Physical Theatre']",['Germany'],[]

They were just resistant to norms, or more receptive to certain channels of the mind. During their years of imprisonment, they wrote letters, so people would remember them. Words of hope, love, confession, reproach, incomprehension, and mad desire, their so-called raw art texts are true songs of life. “I don't want to be removed from circulatation,” wrote Daiber Samuel Ernest, whom no one had read until today. Most often, those men and women didn't know why they had been institutionalised, and none of them, of course, thought they were creating art. And yet. “It's art in its very infancy,” according to Anouk Grinberg who, with the help of Nicolas Repac, has decided to give voice to those stories never before heard from which explode words of absolute power, full of linguistic invention. By joining their “voices” as actress and musician, they put those unknown authors alongside poets such as Henri Michaux, Emily Dickinson, or Ingeborg Bachmann. Because what matters is to “take those texts out of the ghetto of insanity, and to embrace the life they contain. It's always happy, even when it is sad.

Beyond the judgment of society, her brother deserves to rest in dignity, and she will do anything to honour him with one simple gesture: sprinkling dust on his body. That is why this symbolic text so strongly touched the actors-inmates of the Avignon-Le Pontet prison, “who deeply understood this idea that a man remains a man, regardless of what he's done.” This is director Olivier Py's third creation with them.","['Classical', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['France'],['French']

Of the rigid society of The Hague Louis Couperus described in his novel, Ivo van Hove keeps the stifling atmosphere and the tragic aspect. The stage is a waiting room or a purgatory, a place of disillusionment, an abyss in which buried feelings are either reined in or unleashed. The resonating beat of a clock tells the time, a race whose end is inevitable... Dressed all in black, the characters are like an ancient chorus, carrying within themselves an anxiety that squeezes them like a vice, obstructs all desires, and asphyxiates their dreams. Their emotions are sometimes delicate, but they remain first and foremost raw, often abrasive, without pity for this family caught in their own trap. Ivo van Hove, fascinated by Couperus's so modern intuitions, has chosen to explore how one can escape one's destiny and legacy.

That habit remains at the heart of his work as a choreographer, under the guise of solos addressed to famous figures—Joseph Schmidt, Judy Garland, Maria Callas—or to some of his favourite performers—Songs for Takashi or Musiques et mots pour Emmanuel (Music and Words for Emmanuel). They always take the form of a “musical offering,” where his performers express their art through a presence deeply aware of the effects of music and of time, of the imaginary resonance of a voice and a melody. Ornella Balestra—widely recognised for her work with Maurice Béjart—is one of those dancers able to best embody this mixture of intensity and reverie that characterises Raimund Hoghe's dance (see his Swan Lake, 4 Acts, Boléro Variations, Quartet, or La Valse (The Waltz)). In Canzone per Ornella, the choreographer brings together for his dancer music and texts by Pier Paolo Pasolini, both those that have already been explored and those that are still to be experienced, playing with her ability to strike the perfect balance between virtuosity and entertainment, between enigmatic presence and movie-like figure.",['Dance / Movement / Choreography'],['Germany'],[]

It's not a utopian work, which nurtures the hope of easy answers, of ready-made exits, of chimeras of liberation. It's instead about the possibility of looking in the face of those who are below, in the basement of the ship. It's about hearing those voices, these stories, these situations, and letting ourselves be affected by the inexistent place of those who are and remain condemned on the sidelines. It's a show about urgencies.

Alguém Pra Fugir Comigo dá voz a uma necessidade de dizer “basta!” a tantos desmandos, a tantas arbitrariedades, a tantos embrutecimentos, ao juntar um sem número de histórias, que tratam das injustiças sofridas todo dia pelas camadas subalternas. Não se trata de uma obra utópica, que nutre a esperança de respostas fáceis, de saídas prontas, de quimeras de libertação.

Two hundred years later, what do we know of this now-symbolic tragic event, beyond Théodore Géricault's painting? Using statements made by two survivors they meticulously read and analysed, the collective Les Bâtards dorés invite us to experience the 1816 trial judging the violent fight that pit officers and soldiers against one another, and the cannibalistic acts of the survivors. Abandoning the traditional opposition between the room and the stage, they draw the audience into an immersive experience, making them part of the action as witnesses and judges of the events. “Méduse explores humanity in extreme situations. When standing on the edge of the abyss, how does man reveal his true nature: by sharing, competing, or reverting to animalistic behaviour?” Les Bâtards dorés give centre stage to the very essence of human relationships, stripped bare by terror and survival instinct.

When men are only passing through, women remain. And in this bourgeois living room in Cairo, they take up all the space. As a place that serves at once to protect family intimacy and to welcome visitors from the outside, this ordinary location provides Ahmed El Attar with countless combinations to express the symbolic and physical imprisonment of the Arab woman and of her children. With Mama, he paints an unforgiving portrait of the mother, made monstrous by her limitless love, and uses his thirteen characters and this living room to expose the audience to a miniature society made up of alternating relationships of power. Each is at the service of the others, and lets him- or herself be buried under things left unsaid. With this play—the last in a trilogy about family—the director dares to shift our point of view on the mother, too often seen as an untouchable object to honour and cherish, in order to make her the mistress of her own destiny, and more largely to explore her responsibility in our time of crisis.

A journey into the origins of Arab myths, led by a priestess—responsible for the crossing of dead souls into the next world—urging men to feel the grief of loss. Putting masculinity and its insistence on strength and heroism to the test, it reveals the weaknesses and helplessness of those men for whom crying is forbidden.

Just like a novelist interrupts his plot to establish a setting, and just like reading itself can only be a discontinuous activity interrupted by the events of our everyday lives, the eight-hour show in which Julien Gosselin and his collective submerge us is above all a sensory experience.

At once a concert and a recital, Romances inciertos, another Orlando is made up of three acts, evoking a memory or an opéra-ballet. First comes the Doncella Guerrera, a medieval figure which leads us on the trail of a young woman who left for war disguised as a man; then Federico Garcia Lorca's San Miguel, a voluptuous archangel and an object of devotion; and finally the Tarara, an Andalusian gypsy, mystic and seductive, who carries the secret of her androgyny. Against a delicate baroque background, François Chaignaud and Nino Laisné have chosen to reflect those three uncertain identities with a mix of musical and choreographic styles. With its four musicians (bandoneon, theorbo/baroque guitar, viol, and percussion), this other Orlando turns into an epic whose constant metamorphoses serve an unremitting quest for an ideal.","['Contemporary', 'Dance / Movement / Choreography', 'Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental', 'LGBTQIA*', 'Migration', 'Opera', 'Physical Theatre']",['France'],[]

But those hopes were quickly dashed... The novel by Japanese-American writer Julie Otsuka is about those arrivals, and the disappointments that ensued. From the everyday details of those “new poor lives,” the writer weaves a story that ties together two continents until the Second World War, and tells of the stigmatisation of an entire community, which turned invisible in response. Director Richard Brunel, moved by this tragedy, decided to adapt this text for the theatre. To give voice to those diverse stories brought together by their similar outcome, he has surrounded himself with actresses and actors, with all their differences, and leads them on the way to becoming a collective “we” to better highlight those successive disappearances, both individual and collective, and to explore an American landscape which absorbs as much as it rejects.

She recalls the initial diagnosis of Stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer from her oncologist, Dr Harvey Kelekian. Dr Kelekian then proposes an experimental chemotherapeutic treatment regimen consisting of eight rounds at full dosage. Vivian agrees to the treatment.

Over the course of the play, Vivian reflects on her life through the intricacies of the English language, especially the use of wit in the metaphysical poetry of John Donne. Throughout the play, she recites Donne's Holy Sonnet X, ""Death Be Not Proud,"" while reflecting upon her condition. (In the revised edition of John Donne's Holy Sonnets, ""If Poysonous Mineralls"" and ""Death Be Not Proud"" are sonnets IX and X, respectively.) As a professor, she has a reputation for rigorous teaching methods. She has lived her life alone, is unmarried and without children, her parents are deceased, and she has no emergency contact.

Vivian recalls undergoing tests by various medical technicians and being the subject of grand rounds. She remembers sharing a love of language and books with her father. She flashes back to her experiences as a student of Dr E. M. Ashford, an expert on John Donne. Bearing later finds herself under the care of Dr Jason Posner, an oncology research fellow who has taken her class on John Donne. At the hospital, she recognizes that doctors are interested in her for her research value and, like her, tend to ignore humanity in favor of knowledge. Gradually, she realizes that she would prefer kindness to intellectualism.

Vivian reaches the end stage in extreme pain as Susie Monahan, a nurse at the medical centre, offers Vivian compassion and discusses with her the option of exercising her final option, ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR), in case of a severe decline in her condition. Vivian decides to mark the DNR option. Dr Ashford, in town for her great-grandson's birthday, visits the hospital after learning of Vivian's cancer. She comforts her and offers to read a Donne sonnet, but Vivian, scarcely conscious, declines. Instead, Ashford reads from Margaret Wise Brown's The Runaway Bunny, which she had bought for her great-grandson. Dr Ashford disappears from the script without any exit.

When Vivian flatlines, Jason tries to resuscitate her, and calls in a medical team to administer CPR. Susie tries to stop him, pointing out the DNR instruction. Jason eventually realizes his mistake and calls for the CPR team to stop.

As Odysseus encounters the one-eyed Cyclops, Telemachus struggles to keep their home safe from greedy suitors. As Odysseus battles raging seas and the sly Circe, Telemachus himself sets sail to find his father. And on their parallel journeys, Odysseus and Telemachus encounter monsters and seas so treacherous that they are challenged to their limits. Will they survive to return home? If they do, what kind of heroes will they have become? This Odyssey imagines a somewhat different ending from Homer's epic. But the questions to be faced are the same set out in the ancient story. How do we protect our homes? What makes something or someone a monster? How do we deal with the monsters we encounter overseas? What does it mean to be a hero, to grow up, to be civilized? How does each one of us, despite our age, fears or background, confront the obstacles that life places in our path and find our way through?",['Young People / Children / Educational'],['United States'],['English']

Having recently demolished another car, Daisy Werthan, a rich, sharp-tongued Jewish widow of seventy-two, is informed by her son, Boolie, that henceforth she must rely on the services of a chauffeur. The person he hires for the job is a thoughtful, unemployed black man, Hoke, whom Miss Daisy immediately regards with disdain and who, in turn, is not impressed with his employer's patronizing tone and, he believes, her latent prejudice. But, in a series of absorbing scenes spanning twenty-five years, the two, despite their mutual differences, grow ever closer to, and more dependent on, each other, until, eventually, they become almost a couple. Slowly and steadily the dignified, good-natured Hoke breaks down the stern defenses of the ornery old lady, as she teaches him to read and write and, in a gesture of good will and shared concern, invites him to join her at a banquet in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. As the play ends Hoke has a final visit with Miss Daisy, now ninety-seven and confined to a nursing home, and while it is evident that a vestige of her fierce independence and sense of position still remain, it is also movingly clear that they have both come to realize they have more in common than they ever believed possible—and that times and circumstances would ever allow them to publicly admit.

The tragedy Thomas Jolly has chosen to adapt is Seneca's most extreme, most savage, and the one where the supernatural is most present. Its themes—adultery, theft, infanticide, and cannibalism—are impossible to represent, and the means invented to present them—pain, rage, and harmful intentions—implacable. Doubtless because Thyestes isn't the only victim of this attack that makes even thinking impossible... Atreus's sudden and radical transformation into a monster reflects the collapse of the order of the world. There is no more balance or harmony to be found.

How to represent violence on the stage? What is emotion, truth, presence, artistic engagement?

And when they finally escape it, the world refuses to recognise their true form. Violence, the streets, the institutions, workplace harassment, their family's refusal to understand, they've known all that... Starting in Barcelona, where they're from and where Didier Ruiz met them for the first time, they tell their stories. Struggle after struggle, it becomes unclear whether what matters is the journey or the destination. “Meeting them forced me to look up,” Didier Ruiz remembers, he who so often over the past twenty years has given voice to people one rarely hears from in theatres (factory workers, old people, prisoners...). Didier Ruiz describes TRANS (més enllà) as both creation and denunciation, to change “an intolerant society which no longer talks about love.” The second half of a diptych about those we don't see, this new opus is an attempt, through the question of gender, to better understand the complexity of humanity, at once personal and political.","['LGBTQIA*', 'New Work']",['Spain'],['Spanish']

Angelo is left in charge by the Duke, who pretends to leave town but instead dresses as a friar to observe the goings-on in his absence. Angelo is strict, moralistic, and unwavering in his decision-making; he decides that there is too much freedom in Vienna and takes it upon himself to rid the city of brothels and unlawful sexual activity. Laws against these behaviors and institutions already exist, and Angelo simply decides to enforce them more strictly. Claudio is arrested for impregnating Juliet, his lover, before they were married. Although they were engaged and their sexual intercourse was consensual, Claudio is sentenced to death in order to serve as an example to the other Viennese citizens.

Isabella, Claudio's sister, is about to enter a nunnery when her brother is arrested. She is unfailingly virtuous, religious, and chaste. When she hears of her brother's arrest, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He refuses, but suggests that there might be some way to change his mind. When he propositions her, saying that he will let Claudio live if she agrees to have sexual intercourse with him, she is shocked and immediately refuses. Her brother agrees at first but then changes his mind. Isabella is left to contemplate a very important decision.

Isabella is, in a way, let off the hook when the Duke, dressed as a friar, intervenes. He tells her that Angelo's former lover, Mariana, was engaged to be married to him, but he abandoned her when she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Duke forms a plan by which Isabella will agree to have sex with the Angelo, but then Mariana will go in her place. The next morning, Angelo will pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana according to the law.

Everything goes according to plan, except that Angelo does not pardon Claudio, fearing revenge. The provost and the Duke send him the head of a dead pirate, claiming that it belonged to Claudio, and Angelo believes that his orders were carried out. Isabella is told that her brother is dead, and that she should submit a complaint to the Duke, who is due to arrive shortly, accusing Angelo of immoral acts.

The Duke returns in his usual clothes, saying that he will hear all grievances immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke pretends not to believe her. Eventually, the Duke reveals his dual identity, and everyone is forced to be honest. Angelo confesses to his misdeeds, Claudio is pardoned, and the Duke asks Isabella to marry him.",['Classical'],['United Kingdom'],['English']

QTxi8WGCmW4SKK3iA,Super Night Shot,"[{'_id': 'zA3JppQYfum2BL3cJ', 'name': 'Gob Squad'}]","Super Night Shot is a magical journey through the night time streets of a not too distant city. Full of unexpected surprises, the public become co-stars in a movie that celebrates unplanned meetings with strangers and delights in the randomness of urban existence. Both comical and moving, Super Night Shot attempts to elevate the banality of everyday life into the glamour and glitz of a big screen blockbuster. It’s a completely unpredictable show that elevates the everyday into the epic and plays with your perceptions of the familiar. Anything can happen, and usually does...
 
The film begins exactly one hour before you come to watch it when the four performer/activists meet, arm themselves with their video cameras and start them simultaneously. With their watches synchronised, they state their manifesto with military precision:
 
“Each of us is just one in a million, easy to replace and easy to forget in a city that doesn’t really need us. But don’t worry. We’re going to change all that. We’ve got a plan. This city will need us and this film will be our witness.”
 
Embarking on a War On Anonymity, they set off into the night on an adventure where only one thing is certain: 60 minutes later they will meet again and present what they have filmed to the waiting audience. The city becomes a film set, a place where cigarette butts, graffiti, cars and buildings become props and facades and every passer-by is a potential extra, friend, lover or liberator. Working under the constraints of the time limit (the length of the DV tapes) the group set out to capture a great moment of emotion, passion and liberation on camera and bring it back to the waiting audience who themselves take part in the final scene, a heroes welcome. Once the tapes have rewound, performers and audience watch the results together. The sound is mixed live and scored with elements from film soundtracks. The result is an experience halfway between theatre and film that comments on our relationship to the urban environment. A movie that is both fantastical and documentary, that is at the same time a product and a process, both a “making of” and the thing itself.
 
Super Night Shot is Gob Squad’s most widely toured produc- tion, with nearly 200 unique presentations since the project’s inception in 2003, each one shot and screened only once in the host city. The piece has been performed in 4 languages on 6 continents and is still as fresh, dangerous and exciting as the day the 4 performer/activists first stepped onto the icy streets of Berlin in order wage their “War on Anonymity”.
 
Over the years, the film’s hero (a role rotated amongst Gob Squad’s performers) has done his/her best to solve all the problems thrown at them. In Siberia, the hero was asked to bring warmth to the city and melt the snow, in Brazil, the hero bridged the gap between rich and poor and helped raise money for a homeless woman to buy milk for her baby. In London, the hero gave some instant marriage guidance to quarrelling pensioners. In Bangalore, the hero provided security for a market trader and during a recent mission in the company’s home town of Berlin the hero helped some confused shoppers assemble their new Ikea shelves...","['Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental']",['Germany'],"['German', 'English']"

No one is where they are. They are talking to someone miles away. I miss them. But they are missing out - Sherry Turkle in Alone Together
Western Society is a portrait of civilisation in the 21st century, like a frame through which we can peep into the living room of an unknown family, and recognize ourselves. 
 
Returning to our fascination with technology, this time Gob Squad zoom our camera directly into the centre of the western home. By exploring the internet’s remote darkness, Gob Squad have brought back a tiny satellite, a fairly unspectacular unwatched video of an anonymous living room, of a family gathering somewhere at the edge of the western world. There’s a party going on. A room full of people. Family, friends and strangers are all being held together by a karaoke machine: alone together and together alone.
 
Gob Squad, dripping in bling, want to bring this little moment of lived reality back to life and they want to get the image just right. What are we doing here? What is this? Is this happiness? The performers keep asking themselves the same questions, wondering how the hell they got where they are today.
 
As the performers search for answers, test their knowledge, show their best sides and spill their stories, reconstructing and projecting themselves into this tiny piece of history over and over again, a few lucky audience members may win the chance to take part in the shiny golden image. 
 
Western Society is inviting and isolating. It’s heaven and hell. Some see a nightmare, others a place they wished they could be – too real, too fake, too familiar, too strange. 
 
Meanwhile, always somewhere, and despite everything the party goes on and on and on. Everyone is there, young and old and all those in the middle, and you are there too…","['Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental']",['Germany'],"['German', 'English']"

Given the assignment (by an absent teacher) to explain the statement the students begin to weave a tale that is both as familiar as it is absurd. And tragically true (well at least based on a true story).

An alternate version of history. A parable about the eternal battle of inheritance between two brothers and the fate of two tribes.

The classic tale. Since the beginning of time.

We begin our story in an average Berlin classroom. Which is divided by music allegiances as is usually the case. Although music should unite us, for them it’s a sign of their tribe, separating the cool from the silly.

And suddenly there is a Jinn, a slippery figure from the shadows, If it wasn’t for her, everyone would be living happily ever after. But as human nature has its light and dark side so does the Jinn. Mainly dark, though. And the darkness feeds the lies.

A cast of eleven talented young people bring this tale to life using physicality, body percussion and song.",['Young People / Children / Educational'],['Germany'],['English']

There are riots in progress, after stores of grain were withheld from ordinary citizens. The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Marcius, a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the loss of their grain. The rioters encounter a patrician named Menenius Agrippa, as well as Caius Marcius himself. Menenius tries to calm the rioters, while Marcius is openly contemptuous, and says that the plebeians were not worthy of the grain because of their lack of military service. Two of the tribunes of Rome, Brutus and Sicinius, privately denounce Marcius. He leaves Rome after news arrives that a Volscian army is in the field.

The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius, has fought Marcius on several occasions and considers him a blood enemy. The Roman army is commanded by Cominius, with Marcius as his deputy. While Cominius takes his soldiers to meet Aufidius' army, Marcius leads a rally against the Volscian city of Corioli. The siege of Corioli is initially unsuccessful, but Marcius is able to force open the gates of the city, and the Romans conquer it. Even though he is exhausted from the fighting, Marcius marches quickly to join Cominius and fight the other Volscian force. Marcius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which ends only when Aufidius' own soldiers drag him away from the battle.
An 1800 painting by Richard Westall of Volumnia pleading with Coriolanus not to destroy Rome.

In recognition of his great courage, Cominius gives Caius Marcius the agnomen, or ""official nickname"", of Coriolanus. When they return to Rome, Coriolanus's mother Volumnia encourages her son to run for consul. Coriolanus is hesitant to do this, but he bows to his mother's wishes. He effortlessly wins the support of the Roman Senate, and seems at first to have won over the plebeians as well. However, Brutus and Sicinius scheme to defeat Coriolanus and whip up another riot in opposition to his becoming consul. Faced with this opposition, Coriolanus flies into a rage and rails against the concept of popular rule. He compares allowing plebeians to have power over the patricians to allowing ""crows to peck the eagles"". The two tribunes condemn Coriolanus as a traitor for his words, and order him to be banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who banishes Rome from his presence.

After being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium, and offers to let Aufidius kill him to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus, and allow him to lead a new assault on Rome.

Rome, in its panic, tries desperately to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance, but both Cominius and Menenius fail. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet her son, along with Coriolanus's wife Virgilia and their child, and the chaste gentlewoman Valeria. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome, and Coriolanus instead concludes a peace treaty between the Volscians and the Romans.

The tex is based on real events and inspired by Phedra de Córdoba and Savanah Meireles. It mixes nonsensical comedy, drama, vaudeville, dubbing and farce, in a purposefully aesthetic transgression. The solitude of the big city, the social isolation of transsexuals and transvestites*, and the difficulties of love are part of this universe of verbal games and comic clashes.

Transex was extremely important in the history of the Satyros for being one of the first plays of the company in Roosevelt Square with a documentary approach. The production brought together transgender people who lived around the headquarters of the group. Among them, Phedra de Córdoba and Savanah Meireles.

The play talks about love and chance, bringing references from the trans universe, transvestites*, drag queens, crossdressers, prostitution in the 60s and 70s, pornochanchada cinema, the hippie world and the intense need for freedom of expression in a country dominated by the military regime. At a time when many Brazilians are clamoring for the return of military intervention, the Satyros seek to celebrate freedom first and foremost.

The transvestite* Tereza and the pornochanchada actress Marlene Bréa share an apartment in Roosevelt Square. One of them - Tereza - is in love with a being from another dimension. At one point the two are visited by René, Tereza's painting teacher (a transsexual man) who talks about his code of love inspired by the medieval codes, and reveals to Tereza that she is the one chosen to receive his love.

The scenic aspects and costumes are set in the late 60's, the golden age of Roosevelt Square and first appearance of the aesthetics of pornochanchada in the Street of Triumph, in São Paulo.

O texto, baseado em fatos reais e inspirado em Phedra de Córdoba e Savanah Meireles, mescla comédia nonsense, drama, vaudeville, dublagem e farsa, em uma transgressão estética proposital. A solidão da grande cidade, o isolamento social dos transexuais e travestis e as dificuldades do amor fazem parte deste universo de jogos verbais e confrontos cômicos.

Transex foi extremamente importante na história d’Os Satyros, por ser uma das primeiras montagens da Cia na Praça Roosevelt com abordagem documental. A montagem trazia transexuais que viviam no entorno da sede do grupo. Entre elas, Phedra de Córdoba e Savanah Meireles.

A peça fala sobre o amor e o acaso, trazendo referências do universo trans, travesti, drag queen, crossdresser, da prostituição nos anos 60/70, do cinema da pornochanchada, do mundo hippie e da intensa necessidade da liberdade de expressão em um país dominado pelo regime militar. Em um momento onde muitos brasileiros clamam pelo retorno de uma intervenção militar, Os Satyros buscam celebrar a liberdade em primeiro lugar.

In it, Miziara and Helô interpret the fictional John Marcher and May Bartram, friends of a whole lifetime, incapable of investing in a probable love.

The third part breaks the barrier with the viewer and shows the actors in a process of compositions of each of these characters. On the whole, Miziara and Helô call attention by virtue of a detailed narrative, which describes the scenes with almost didactic details, as if the idea were also to provoke the public to find a complement in the literary original. If a more inventive scenario is dispensed with, there are, however, two moments in which the performers stand out and reach fullness.

Fifteen years earlier, they had a sexual relationship for three months when Una was 12 and Ray was 40; subsequently, Ray had been jailed for three years for statutory rape. Ultimately, they ran off together, and, while Ray was taking time to compose himself after realizing what he had just done, he left her alone in a motel room. She got worried and left to find him, which led to both of them frantically searching for one another and raising suspicions within the small coastal town where they were staying. Eventually, a couple out walking their dog took Una in and called the police after learning why she was there. Ray was then arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he managed to establish a reasonably successful new life under another name, but Una recognized him in a photograph and tracked him down.

Ray takes Una to the office break room, where the two engage in a long and difficult confrontation involving Una's continuing struggles to understand and come to terms with the abuse and her intensely conflicting emotions, which pivot between anger, curiosity, confusion, and even a persistent attachment to Ray, whom Una loved – and she believed that he loved her.

It’s going up in a few months. Feeling the deadline pressure? It’s time to stage a dramaturgical intervention. Dramaturgs normally work from the early conception stages on a performance, from concept through research into rehearsals. However, if time is shortn a dramaturg can offer a period of facilitation on script drafts, ensemble improvisations or workshops merging text and performance. 
A dramaturg can:
• assess the material you have gathered to date against the intentions you started the project with;
• offer verbal and written feedback on text or floor work;
• contribute to organising a process of work that maximises the time you have to develop your show;
• combine the notes on text and performance with that process and create objectives and desired outcomes, a roadmap for your project;

Madame Geneva, the popular name for Gin, lands with the Dutch armies of William of Orange. Almost immediately she invokes a gloriously decadent atmosphere across the rapidly growing city.

The anti-gin movement inextricably link her with fallen women, and drunken fishwives in a bid to eradicate her, manifesting in a reforming approach for women of middle and lower classes. Madame Geneva portrays a ferociously exciting time, telling its tale through some of the most exciting, dark and interesting characters of the day.

Marjorie's roommates are away when a charismatic stranger, Raul, enters her home and attempts to rape her. After Marjorie is able to gain the upper hand, Patricia and Terry arrive home to find Raul bound and gagged in their fireplace, at the hands of their friend turned vigilante. The three women are forced to negotiate his fate as the moral narrative is warped and twisted throughout this suspense thriller in one act.

Select performances will be followed by special guest speakers (including HOPE HALL: President OBAMA’s former Principal Videographer; BEFRANK Founders and creators of the viral PORN OR #METOO docu-series), talkbacks with the cast and our director, and panel discussions regarding the themes of Extremities.

A marionette show for kids and adults based on Eastern European folklore premiering September 2018 in the Vancouver Fringe 2018.

Puppet show, you say? Yes! Our handmade marionettes are waiting to tell you the story of Baba Yaga. 
This ancient Russian forest entity is cosmically cranky and lives in a chicken-legged house. There’s only one thing that can stop her and it isn’t love. 

Inspired by folktales of old, adorned with a set of antique 60-year-old marionettes, infused with Eastern European music and performed by one-person-puppet-theatre - our new story has all the classic elements of the thriller for kids: the grieving King, the beautiful Princess and the cruel Villain. And then of course there is an unexpected twist... 

Produced and performed by professional puppeteer Viktor Barkar (Vancouver Puppet Theatre) and directed by Karen Petersen, our new interactive marionette show is an unique opportunity to introduce your children to the magic of the puppet theatre and bring the whole family to the Vancouver Fringe 2018! Marionettes are build by legendary Betty Kirkham.

The satirical comedy about a miserly uncle, his love-struck nephew, and their wily servants, was banned in 1790 by the censor for its social critique and strong language.

The play centers on a rich, miserly old uncle, Don Lucas. With no direct heirs, he is surrounded by relatives wanting to be named in his will. None is more desperate than his nephew, Don Pedro, who needs the inheritance in order to court and marry Doña Isabel, whom he adores. Don Pedro’s wily manservant, Crispín vows to help his master, with the assistance of Don Lucas’ clever housemaid, Lucía. Of course, there are twists and turns in the plot that put the plans at risk and threaten the lives of the schemers! The comedy’s characters owe their formation to commedia dell’arte. However, this play departs from commedia with the presence of its strong-willed women who are intellectual equals to the men at all levels of society.

Spirited north to Alta California, the play was performed at the Villa de Branciforte  by “los voluntarios de Cataluña,” sometime between 1796 and 1821, and eventually archived by Herbert Bancroft at the University of California, Berkeley. In A History of Hispanic Theatre in the United States: Origins to 1940,  historian Nicolás Kanellos cites the play as the “first drama staged in California.”

The script was recently unearthed and transcribed by Dr. Pedro García-Caro (Romance Languages & Latin American Studies), and translated by Olga Sanchez Saltveit (PhD candidate, Theatre Arts). Sanchez Saltveit sets the play in Alta California, 1796, imaging its first performance in the Villa de Branciforte. “Given its stratified and racialized society, what if the servants of Branciforte also performed in the play?” This adaptation complicates California history by including the power dynamics of Spanish colonialism, and the hierarchies of privilege at work in Spanish society among the Peninsulars, Criollos, Mestizos, Afrodescendants, Asians, and the Indigenous people of Alta California.

“Readers and audience members should be able to imagine the heterogeneity of class, ethnicity, and gender that was originally part of the staging and reception of this work of critical and satirical entertainment. Today, [Tricks] seeks to pass on its own cultural inheritance, and to take its place not only within the corpus of late colonial Mexican literature, but also within the Latinx cultural corpus of the United States.” – Pedro García-Caro, “A Play for Branciforte.”

Coming all the way from Australia, Robbie T is delighted to bring to Vancouver a uniquely strange show, entitled Weirdo (a magician's transformative journey, from socially awkward to utterly inept). 

Robbie makes his living as a magician. But despite what you see on TV, magicians are generally uncool. Robbie is no exception. Awkwardly elegant, and elegantly awkward, Robbie is prone to over sharing. Through a unique blend of interactive theatre, magic, and storytelling, Robbie reveals his inner weirdo, and encourages the audience to embrace their own. 

During this 55 minute show, Robbie will share genuine diary entries and photographs from his tortured childhood, along with insights into his first ever crush, his reasons for delving into magic, and so much more. An engaging one-man show, full of wonder and attempts at humour, with audience participation being mandatory. 

At times during the show, it may appear as though not everything is going to plan. But it is this carefully planned illusion of incompetence, which will build towards a remarkable climax. It is not a children’s show. Nor is it a typical magic show. It is aimed at discerning adults (or teens with parents). 

This is Robbie's most ambitious and creative work to date, with the material and nature of the show, being markedly different from his day-to-day paid performances. The show was first performed to sell-out crowds in the Perth Fringe Festival (Australia) in February 2018, before being revised and again performed at the Melbourne Magic Festival in July 2018. 

A sizzle reel for the show can be viewed here: https://vimeo.com/262129825.

""...an interesting sense of humour, quick-witted, although a little odd. He is self-deprecating, charming and easily engaged participants to assist him in his acts"". FringeFeed.

Two young Latinas meet at a band audition. Luisa is effortlessly sexy, and sings like an angel. Sally, though musically brilliant, is rough-edged, moody, and tortured by her fluctuating sexuality. There's an undeniable symbiosis between them and they form their own band. Seemingly overnight they have fame and a following. Enter Nigel, an older glam rocker. Seeking something new, he asks Sally to join his band. She's torn: the offer is intoxicating, but what about Luisa? Sally accepts Nigel's offer. Luisa segues to a spectacular pop career strictly on her own. Sally feels a queasy mix of regret and contempt.

Thirty years pass. Drugs and hard-living have exacted a brutal toll on Sally and Nigel. Age and illness have dimmed Luisa's star and diminished her powers. And Nigel is dying. To help him do so with dignity, Sally seeks Luisa's help. The gesture opens old wounds, but makes healing possible, too.

                  W.K. is a play about love, it's about your first love and mine. Driven by movement, this pop culture collage follows a 7 year romance from beginning to end. Filled with swing dancing, karaoke, sex, revenge, and lots of kissing, W.K. asks the question: how does your first love change you and can you ever return to the way you were before?

""W.K. was inspired by the marriage of my grandparents. For the last 7 years (yes, 7 whole years) of their married life, my grandparents did not speak a single word to one another. Living under the same roof with 3 children, their relationship was completely reduced to typewritten letters and chalk scribbles. My grandparents were each other’s first loves and last, neither one ever fully recovering from the implosion of their relationship. Inspired by their story and the fact that I don’t know if anyone ever truly recovers from their first attempts at love, we’ve created “W.K.”, a movement infused pop culture collage filled with swing dancing, bingo, sex, audience interaction, karaoke versions of “Loving You” by Minnie Ripperton, neuroscience, laughter, revenge and lots of kissing.Taking place over 7 years, we witness the genesis of love and deterioration of intimacy for our two main characters, Willie & Kathy. As their verbal discussion drops away, the body becomes the main instrument for dialogue, creating a world of sharp changes and deep misunderstanding. What happens when we are unable to speak to the one we love? ""W.K.” examines our obsession with intimacy and what happens when we fail on our first try."" -Katherine Wilkinson, Director

These ideal, immortal and  unemotional beings are certain that man is but a collection of personal interests and empty ethical cliches. People are incapable of rejecting temptation and are always ready to betray. As such, mankind’s time on earth has come to an end.

Keti Chukhrov comments:
“Mankind increasingly seeks to exceed the limits of the human: the unknown, the unfamiliar and everything that cannot be controlled continue to entice us with their boundlessness. We must have intellect in order to learn and to conquer new territories of knowledge. We must control systems and technology in order to manage the spheres of economy and politics.  It is enough to have a biological body and the functions of intellect in order to do that.

“It so happens that man is akin to an 'animal' when he is led by instinct and individual interests, and he is a 'machine' when he takes control of those instincts and interests. If that is true, then one need not remain human in order to gain power and broaden one's horizons of knowledge. This essentially is the Faustian question.

Highly physical and poetic, The Brutes explores the lengths to which we will go to survive, to retain hope, and to protect ourselves and those we cherish from the poisons of war.

Allen'}]","Sometimes a simple appearing story contains universal issues such as loss, abandonment, renewal, and hope for the future.  Set in Depression era, dustbowl Oklahoma, W.G.Allen’s play, Lost Letter grapples with all of these with love and humor.

It's November, 1935, and the U.S. Government has found an 18 year old letter written to a resident of the little town of Oxbow, Oklahoma. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, enjoying the popularity of his 'Fireside Chats,' has decided to have the letter delivered on a live radio broadcast, hoping this will provide a ""shot of hope"" to counter the seemingly endless rigors of The Depression and Dust Bowl. When  the government official assigned to arrange the broadcast, arrives in Oxbow, what he discovers threatens to turn what could have been a great human interest story into a disaster for everyone concerned... especially for the people of Oxbow!
Director George Williams says he has a “special passion” for this play, only partly because he is also the author!  Williams has directed a number of productions in Oklahoma, and written many others.  (He appeared as the deceived Orgon in the ADOBE's recent production of “Tartuffe.”)  Of  Lost Letter, Williams says:  ""This is, in essence, a slice of Americana. It's a story of  'country folk' and 'city folk,' who are sometimes in conflict, but who are all trying to do the right thing in a very difficult  time and situation.""
The 'country folk' include ""Jib Barlow"" (played by Katie Mitchell), her Aunt Bernice (Stephanie Larragoite), local widow lady Maude Carter (Patricia Thompson), and local craftsmen Charley Peterson (Tom Monahan) and ""Grits"" Parker (Stephen Zamora). The 'city folk' are ably represented by government official Aaron Wilcox (Alan Hudson), WPA worker Clay Brady (Micah Linford), radio technician Ron Vincenti (Tim Riley), and the famous radio announcer T. Jefferson Booth (Clifton Chadwick).

The project is conducted in a manner that is completely new for Russian theatre: the genre of the open-circuited workspace. The project is so constructed that it will undergo constant change and development.

Each of the five days of *The Golden Ass* consists of daytime showings of modules (2 to 6 p.m.) and evening compositions (7 to 11 p.m.). Modules are independent scenes created by project participants and they may be shown in fragments or interrupted by Boris Yukhananov, who publicly discusses them on the spot. Compositions consist of two “Shaggy” and “White” segments, and one “City” segment. Compositions are fully-fledged performances consisting of episodic scenes in which the text of Apuleius’ novel intertwines with the commentary of those participating in the action.

The five-day project reflects its structure, which is constructed like the two wings of a butterfly (each consisting of two parts, the upper and lower – “Shaggy” and “White”) and its body (“City”). In this way a butterfly takes shape before the eyes of spectators in a logical, though non-linear fashion; first the left wing, then the caterpillar-body (“City”), and finally the right wing. As soon as the butterfly takes shape it figuratively takes wing – which is to say that the given composition assumes a new life as a full-fledged production in the repertoire of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre. But the butterfly exists physically too – it flies over the stage, quite alive.

The text of each composition is an intertwining of fragments of Apuleius’ novel - including the story inserts, the so-called “Milesian fables” - and live speech (although the actors commit it to memory as if it were a role), wherein the actor reveals to us his or her own concerns and thoughts. As such, the tale of Psyche falling in love with Cupid emerges as a central motif of a “Shaggy” composition. Psyche, performed by Alla Kazakova in a “Shaggy” episode, furiously shoots at Cupid who seems to have stolen her story. She does this not as the character Psyche, but as the actress playing the role of Psyche. Two other incarnations of the goddess Isis come to life within the compositions – Klim (Klim Kozinsky) and Isis-Cicer (Andrei Yemelyanov), who interrupt performances with callous or sympathetic commentaries. They argue even as they take care the columns don’t fall over.","['Classical', 'Devised / Ensemble', 'Experimental', 'New Work']",['Russia'],['Russian']

In 1437, the Portuguese prince Don Fernando is taken prisoner by the Sultan of Morocco after an unsuccessful military expedition. In exchange for his freedom, the prince is ordered by the Sultan to destroy the town of Ceuta, a Catholic stronghold in North Africa. Prince Fernando decides that his life is not worth such a concession. He prefers life as a slave in a Muslim prison.

Fernando died in 1443. He was made a saint by the Catholic Church, and his heroic deed was glorified, in part, becoming the subject of Calderon's philosophical drama, *The Constant Prince* (El Principe constant, 1629).

The performance is accompanied by English-language supertitles.

Boris Yukhananov on *The Constant Principle*:
The goal here isn't to be liked or to entertain. There is a certain pain here that haunts me. By nature I am bound up in things spectacular, by which I mean to say that I love the integrity of theater, although this integrity has fallen ill in my soul. Something has happened to it. Hence, this huge work, in the making for nearly three years, is shot through with pain. In this regard it may shock some or be unbearable to others. There is nothing I can do about that.

That is the nature of the baroque, everything is slipped into specific layers, in which pain and joy lie on top of each other and, sometimes, like lovers, they roll over and exchange places. That's how the baroque arises. It arises in the intersection of culturally taboo limits, and there is no way getting around that.

SuoNDKPYqzT4HE3Aq,Hôtel Feydeau,"[{'_id': '2LFZKQSkEmsPPF5rK', 'name': 'Georges Feydeau'}]","It is the year 1907 and, out of the blue, Feydeau decides to change everything. His shows have been filling theatres for the last fifteen years. He is the uncontested king of the boulevard. Even the critics, after their initial distaste at these ‘minor’ works, have now lain down their weapons. Nobody can match his talent for construing, with such fiendish attention to detail, intrigues of the most outlandish kind, in which each detail generates a whole cascade of catastrophic consequences. Nobody can craft slapstick dialogues as well as he can, each painstakingly rooted in a dramatic movement which justifies every outburst. For, “theatre”, he wrote in 1905, “is above all the development of an action”. Yet, at the age of forty-five years old, and for no apparent reason, he decides to put his title up for grabs.

According to family tradition, it all happened one particularly rainy afternoon at a friend’s house. Feydeau preferred to stay in his room, asked for his writing things to be sent up, and Feu la mère de madame (Madame’s Late Mother) was written in just two days. Staged a few months later, the one-act play added to his list of successes. And justifiably so. Lucien and Yvonne’s truly horrible night together provides us with an explosion of comic goings-on. However, the virtuoso sequences of events and absurd knock-on effects are replaced with something else. Close-ups. This time around the plot appears to hinge on not very much at all. Feydeau needs nothing more than a husband who comes home rather late after a ball dressed up as Louis XIV, and a careless servant bearing bad news who knocks at the wrong door. The rest is all a matter of verve (“Ah ! non ! tu ne vas pas vomir ! je ne t’ai pas épousé pour ça !”), character portrayal (ranging from the irritable and selfish to the downright pathetic ) and invention, with each passing second, of details which eventually pile up to exploding point. A few months later, Feydeau left his marital home to take up lodgings at the Hôtel Terminus, which at least had the merit of making things perfectly clear.

Thus, it was at the Terminus that Feydeau completed his final cycle of theatrical works, visibly inspired by the break-up of his marriage: five variations in one act on the eternal war that wages in certain marital circles. On the way, we encounter such things as bed pans of all shapes and sizes, a wife who suffers from a wasp-bite on the rump, Georges Clemenceau (off stage), an aggressive macaroni and all sorts of stomach complaints, among which is the dismal-sounding ‘entérite relâchée’... Feydeau’s wish was to collate them under the generic title of Du mariage au divorce. However, illness prevented him from doing so.",[],[],['French']

Yury Muravitsky, Yury Kvyatkovsky and Kirill Vytoptov are directors of the same generation but of various backgrounds. Each of them creates their own *Seagull* with actors of the Electrotheatre company. The play’s four acts, from the words, “Why do you always wear black?” to “Konstantin Gavrilovich has shot himself” are broken down into three performances, three visions, three manners of deconstructing a text, three versions of events. Muravitsky offers up a fashion show where each character is doomed to wear his or her lines as if they were costumes. Kvyatkovsky heads up a set of lessons in which Chekhov’s characters and dialogue are reborn by way of actor improvisations. Vytoptov creates a musical “bar” where the play’s characters meet face to face with their doubles from contemporary life. Each of the directors performs the role of the young writer Treplev in the acts staged by his colleagues.

The Theatrical Insomnia project encourages spectators to spend a night not sleeping at home in their comfortable bed, but in the theatre, where this unusual production of *The Seagull* includes more than just the performance - it also includes performative intermissions in the Electrotheatre’s foyer. All of this comes to an end at sun-up as the Moscow metro system reopens for a new day of work.","['Experimental', 'New Work']",['Russia'],['Russian']

Because the ghosts (who are the protagonists in traditional Nō theatre plays) have to leave their bodies and die before they can put their affairs on earth in order. They cannot be laid to rest and so they remain in a state of limbo on the threshold between this world and the afterworld. The Nō theatre paves their way; it could be described as a drama of transition. And no place in 21st century Japan – the setting of all Toshiki Okada’s plays – is so emblematic of transition as the Tokyo subway. This is where people from the most diverse social contexts meet, sleeping side by side, some drunk or giving off body odours. Whether on their way to work, home, to do the shopping or to a bar, the subway transports a huge range of stories through the city – but in reality, they remain unspoken. “Nō Theatre” brings them to light. The second work at the Münchner Kammerspiele by Toshiki Okada – one of the most influential contemporary theatre-makers in Asia – is loosely based on the traditional Nō theatre rules and is a cathartic evocation of the spirits of the present.

The Japanese director and author Toshiki Okada writes plays about a Japan that is shaped by the influences of global capitalism. Bridging tradition and modernity, he unites ordinary situations with a choreographic form that makes the present appear strange. With the actors of the Münchner Kammerspiele he now seeks to adapt the most original form of Japanese theatre: Nō. He will use the classic structure of the Nō theatre and apply it to contemporary Japan. Which unredeemed ghosts are still waiting for their deaths?

Over these two hours audience has been shown everything: parents’ love and spouses’ love, temptation, boredom, passion, friendship, loyalty, grief, oblivion.
Everything was unusual in this show. Music scores, set design, cast of actors, translation of dialogs and questions between two languages, and the idea of cross-cultural interaction of russian and kyrgyz people. ...
The story was about every culture being really different from each other. And this is the difference similar to that one between black and white colors: never would you be able to tell which of these two is better or worse. They are simply different. Russian culture was displayed as a highly contradictory one, with its collision of the spiritual and the mundane, its introspectivity, idleness, hesitation. Kyrgyz culture was shown in its integrity, naturality, simplicity of its moral values, rigidity. <...> This performance seems to be another work of Chinghiz Aytmatov, an unwritten and unedited one, however imbued with the beauty of Kyrgyz people and its culture.»

Ros6q9NbYCobjqhyL,Before Sunset,"[{'_id': '8L5eujqSFXjQMWDPK', 'name': 'Gerhart Hauptmann'}]","A family catastrophe against the backdrop of an agitated world.  Gerhart Hauptmann’s play, written in 1932, gives us an opportunity to consider the place of the individual in the contemporary world. What prevails, the personal or the socially accepted? Control or freedom of choice? These are the questions Hauptmann asked of himself and of society just as fascism began to rise. Today they take on new significance. Hauptmann’s play centers on the historical tragedy of “non-freedom” facing the 70 year-old Matthais Clausen, who falls in love with the young Inken, but who is hindered on all sides by those around him, his family most of all.

Vladimir Kosmachevsky comments: “Hauptmann grasped what this century had in store for us. He saw how, in times of great convulsions, the individual human is turned into a ‘nothing.’ The dignity and freedom of the individual, his or her uniqueness and individuality, would perish in gas attacks and death camps. The only unconditional freedom given the individual is the freedom to dispose of his or her own destiny. The main protagonist here revokes his own biography. But his very own children will not let him rewrite his life anew or relive the emotions of his first and last loves.”","['Experimental', 'New Work', 'Translations / Adaptations', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['Russia'],['Russian']

Leibniz formulates the model of an ideal world, at the center of which lies a soul, or its more simple form – a monad. Achieving an understanding of this world by means of reason, the soul develops and gradually rises to its Creator. But no philosophical dogma is capable of embracing the world: in its efforts to embrace life, it destroys it. The clash of ideas and reality give rise to war.

Prince Myshkin, being either spiritually blind or a genius, is charmed by the idea of unifying two worlds: the world of divine law and the earthly world. Myshkin tries to change the nature of things,  to arouse the soul’s memory of divine principles, thus violating the natural course of things. 
The play does not include Leibniz’s text per se although his ideas are woven into the musical structure of the performance. As such, one pattern - the twists and turns of Dostoyevsky’s novel - is woven into another that is drawn from the world of philosophical ideas and palindromes. The bible which Aglaya Yepanchina holds in her hands is merely a phone book.

Klim Kozinsky comments: 

""The entities of literature and theater are primordially locked in a severe conflict. There are two known ways out: either performance carves literature up and, thanks to the attendant creative tension, creates a new ‘theatrical’ text, or literature subdues theatre, turning it into a pattern of references to the source. I immediately abandoned the kind of theatre where, for some reason, someone must believe someone else, but at the same time I backed out of a literature-centric system, which is extremely obstinate and must be treated with kid gloves. Mine is an attempt not to splice theatre and literature together, but to separate them, thus multiplying them.""","['Contemporary', 'Experimental', 'New Work', 'Translations / Adaptations']",['Russia'],['Russian']

Janet is also curious, but hesitant: They live so close, what if it goes bad, and why is Rich so insistent?

Generalissima is based on a number of studies into Creole languages and the rough speech used by children of slaves.  It is also derived from research into ‘Ars Magna’ by Ramon Llull, the 13th century scholar who invented a universal language based on numerology.
Generalissima is a language which can express multi-layers of meanings, saving time and giving a more abstract and telepathic level of perception. The language is structured into four stages of knowledge, a common level which consists of 400 comprehensive notions, gradually rising to higher and more refined levels until you reach the purest and most concentrated final level, which consists of just four words. Communication is possible at each of these four levels.   

The performance itself is based on the gospel story of Lazarus rising from the dead, as depicted in Giotto’s famous fresco, which shows Christ approaching the grotto. Lazarus’s corpse is surrounded by relatives holding their noses against the stench emanating from the already decaying body.

The slight odor of ammonia is intended as a reminder of decomposing human flesh which the strength of thought resists, demonstrating the miraculous power of the word.

The story is repeated five times, each time on a different level of the Generalissima language. The plasticity and gestures of the actors, which vary from one level to the next, gradually uncover ever deeper meanings in this meeting between man and God.
The empty space where the action takes place is not divided into separate zones; it is one space uniting the actors and the audience. In muted daylight, the spectators move freely amongst the actors, and become witnesses to astonishing miracles and transformations.

No law says we gotta live and die in Harlem, USA, just ‘cause we happened to wind up here when we finally blew out of Savannah. The world is a big place!*

Harlem, 1930. The realities of the depression have kicked in, and blues singer and nightclub performer Angel is struggling to find a job. Her friend Guy, an unemployed costume designer, dreams of designing dresses for Josephine Baker in Paris. Their neighbour Delia, a social worker, is trying to organise a local family planning clinic while their friend Sam, a doctor, works long hours delivering babies at the Harlem Hospital.

Pearl Cleage’s 1995 play portrays the lives of struggling African American artists and activists in the transition between the Harlem Renaissance and the Great Depression. With themes encompassing economic hardship, homosexuality and reproductive rights, *Blues for an Alabama Sky* combines wide social issues with deeply personal dilemmas.

Pearl Cleage is a fiction writer, playwright, poet, essayist and journalist. Her writing draws on experiences as an activist for AIDS and women’s rights, as well as the broader experiences of black Americans. Her first novel, *What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day*, appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for nine weeks in 1998.

hzjJSxDATDdc54TuC,Maniagnosis,"[{'_id': 'd5aJr3HtRJFFmKkoB', 'name': 'Alexander Belousov'}]","Alexander Belousov's chamber opera is a musical and philosophical reflection based on an updating of Spinoza's ideas about the necessary and voluntary union of people on the basis of reason and common good.

""It is before all things useful to men to associate their ways of life, to bind themselves together with such bonds as they think most fitted to gather them all into unity, and generally to do whatsoever serves to strengthen friendship."" (Spinoza. The Ethics. Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata. 1677).

The two-act opera's title combines the words ""mania"" and ""gnosis,"" that is, ""mania"" and ""knowledge."" The libretto is constructed in such a way that a fictitious hero-protagonist emerges from a story-within-a-story about a writer, leading us to the conclusion that ​​the acquisition of knowledge comes by way of mania, or obsession, whatever form that may take.

In the first act a romantic, fledgling writer invents a hero who, it turns out, had lived even before he was invented. This hero begins acting contrary to the author's intentions, performing various ""maniognostic"" deeds (of a sexual, hedonistic, schizophrenic and ""messianic"" nature). In an erotic fever he strangles a pizza delivery girl; discovers a drug dealer bound hand and foot in his closet, and (in Act Two) tortures him as revenge for his older sister's death due to an overdose. Eventually, the drug dealer dies from stress as he witnesses the hero inflicting wounds upon himself. The finale unites everyone precisely as per Spinoza: the bodies that divide us in fact do not divide us. When harming yourself, you harm another.

*Maniagnosis* refers back to the genre of dramma per musica, that is, to the origins of opera when music did not yet dominate a theatre performance. The musical texture alludes to Renaissance vocal polyphony (as per the polyphonies of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina) and to the romantic language of Wagner. The background for the first, naively romantic, act is the sound of a washing machine, which serves as an orchestra for all the goings-on. It is joined by sounds extracted from metal barrels and a steel box. The second act begins with the funeral of the young writer and unfolds against the backdrop of a crystal-clear piano mixed with German, Russian and Latin texts, which are gradually corrupted by alien phonemes that ""pollinate"" the vocals. In this manner, text becomes music.

The gloomy, black and gray functional warehouse space created by designer Stepan Lukyanov transforms into a landscape backed by a starry sky. Anastasia Nefedova's trash-dream costumes of troubled souls lend the performance form and content.

The Moscow debut of composer Alexander Belousov fits well into the overall strategy of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre, which has become a springboard for experimentation in the field of new academic, electronic, and operatic music.","['Experimental', 'Opera']",['Russia'],['Russian']

7v842ZqtGuH8KvSQn,Caen Amour,"[{'_id': 'wZ4gMj9tu2TsTfg3F', 'name': 'Trajal Harrell'}]","Little Egypt who came to the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893, spawned a number of imitators with her “oriental” style of dance. Not unlike many of the early modern dancers who looked to the orient for inspiration, one off-shoot of these vast imitators were the hoochie-koochie shows traveling across the United States from the early twentieth century into the early 1980’s. I posit that from it’s beginning these performances should also be linked to the burgeoning artistic field of dance which, as of yet, had no name. Looking back at the hoochie koochie shows, we might employ our sexist, orientalist, and post-colonialist readings fixed to the male gaze, gender and racial inequality, exoticism, and sexual objectification. However, Caen Amour, perhaps a cheezy title for one of these shows not unlike “Ripe on The Riviera”, or “Love Shack,” takes place in the historical imagination. Here in this personal rendering of a hoochie-koochie show--- most of the historical sexism and other –ism’s remain in place --- to imagine as close as possible to what it might have been. Between the now and then, in the imagination; we welcome you to join us…

Looking through our historical lens we cannot overlook discriminatory practices, as well as social and public policies; here in front of the many daddies, casanovas, marlboro men, peeping toms, pimps, pip squeaks, sharks, playboys, thugs, salamis, and whistlers, we might also find some agency in imagining minimal yet probable possibilities and forms of creative resistance between the cracks of history. At a time when the boundaries between expressionist dancing, erotic dancing, social dancing, religious dancing, folk dancing, and entertainment dancing were yet to be fully carved out making a way for a canonical field of artistic dancing; what kind of liminal experiments could we imagine taking place amongst the women who were dancing and making dance (or as we like to say “shaking and baking it”) in these contexts? Perhaps these artists were well aware of plural modernisms, Spanish dancer La Argentina, Gaugain, naked versus nude, zen, free jazz, hula, questioning primitivism, and the seeds of third wave feminism yet to come at the end of the century. Who knows? Yet, I imagine that what was to later become known as modern dance surely had some of it’s beginnings here too, in the so-called cleavage as well as booty and vagina cracks, where the history is almost completely unrecorded and where herstory --- knowing where feminisms and femininity were well up for debate --- and in the here and now performing that debate (via what writer Alice Walker calls) in search of our mother’s gardens.

Thereby, the work transforms the theatrical audience into the awareness of the gallery viewer’s position to further complexify their own criticality to an imagined past and how each of us fills in the blanks from various political and social awarenesses. Here, a woman re-constructs the limitations of the object of desire in the hoochie koochie while simultaneously trying to experiment with the notion of “woman- native-other.” Here, men, perform as female figures, with the affect of clothing. Real differences between the performance of genders remains leaving a space of reflection on difference: between what we imagine and who they perform; as well as between what we imagine and how we perform as audience. This work for four performers takes place on both sides of a décor/installation/architectural object allowing for multiple viewing perspectives throughout the show. Inspired also by the writing of post-colonial feminist writer and filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-Ha, Caen Amour and the untold history it explores hooks on to one of her quotes: “The story depends upon every one of us to come into being. It needs us all, needs our remembering, understanding, and creating what we have heard together to keep on coming into being.”",[],['United States'],

Through the lens of a seventeenth century witch hunt, *Vinegar Tom* explores hypocrisy and misogyny past and present.

How do you spot a witch? A woman who is a bit too beautiful, a bit too ugly, a bit too clever, a bit too independent? Caryl Churchill’s 1976 work explores the marginalisation of women who are different through the stories of Alice, Joan, Betty and Susan. Accused of witchcraft, they are questioned and humiliated by doctors and witch hunters.

Interspersed with contemporary songs, Churchill’s bold script highlights attitudes towards women through the ages, and the plight of those who are ostracised for not conforming. As we approach the centenary of the woman’s vote in the UK, *Vinegar Tom* still has relevance today.

Caryl Churchill is best known for her works exploring feminism and sexual politics. Her plays include *Top Girls*, *Cloud 9*, *A Mouthful of Birds*, *Serious Money*, *The Skriker* and *Love and Information*.

At the factory, the workers traditionally roll cigars while novels are being read to them as entertainment. A new reader, an elegant young man, comes to the factory.

During a snowstorm UN jets mistakenly drop on their territory a load of military uniforms intended for “peace keepers.” A silent patient, the former Colonel Fetisov (a Russian who lost his family during bombing raids), mobilizes the patients into a small combat unit, dressing them in the uniforms and returning to them the belief that they can be healthy.

“We just want people to know our culture exists,” says Marko Halanevych of DakhaBrakha. “We want people to know as much as possible about our corner of the world.”

The quartet does far more than introduce Ukranian music or prove it is alive and well. They craft stunning new sonic worlds for traditional songs, reinventing their heritage with a keen ear for contemporary resonances. With one foot in the urban avant-garde theater scene and one foot in the village life that nurtured and protected Ukraine’s cultural wealth, DakhaBrakha shows the full fury and sensuality of some of Eastern Europe’s most breathtaking folklore.

“It’s hard to know what to make of Ukrainian band DakhaBrakha when it first arrives on stage—oh, those tall, furry hats!

j7trio7QPJvvQyxE5,Revolution | Pussy Riot,"[{'_id': 'JPxJonPgsuh4AYNmM', 'name': 'Revolution | Pussy Riot'}]","Pussy Riot is a Russian all-female protest art collective based in Moscow. Founded in March 2011, it had a variable membership of approximately 11 women. The group staged unauthorized provocative guerrilla punk rock performances in unusual public places, which were made into music videos and posted on the Internet. The collective’s lyrical themes included feminism, LGBT rights, and opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the group considered to be a dictator. These themes also encompassed Putin’s links to the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church.

They gained global notoriety when five members of the group staged a performance inside Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior in 2012. The group’s actions were regarded sacrilegious by the Orthodox clergy and eventually stopped by church security officials. The women said their protest was directed at the Orthodox Church leaders’ support for Putin during his election campaign. On March, 2012, three of the group members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina, and Yekaterina Samutsevich were arrested and charged with hooliganism. On August 17, 2012, the three members were convicted of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”, and each was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. On October 10, following an appeal, Samutsevich was freed on probation and her sentence suspended. The sentences of the other two women were upheld.

The trial and sentence attracted considerable attention and criticism, particularly in the West. The case was adopted by human-rights groups, including Amnesty International, which designated the women as prisoners of conscience, and by a number of prominent entertainers. Having served 21 months, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were released on December 23, 2013, after the State Duma (Russian Parliament) approved an amnesty. After their release, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina and several other members performed as Pussy Riot during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, where they were attacked with whips and pepper spray by Cossacks who were employed as security guards.

In 2014-2016 Pussy Riot (Alyokhina and Tolokonninkova with different line-ups), recorded and released several videos: “Putin Will Teach You To Love The Motherland”, “I Can’t Breathe”  (named for the last words that Eric Garner said as New York City Police held him to the ground in a chokehold), “Chaika”, “Organs”, “Make America Great Again”. 

Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova appeared as speakers in many international festivals, conferences and other events in the USA, Canada, all Europe, Australia, Singapore. They represented Pussy Riot and Mediazona – very influential Russian human rights online media, founded by Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova in 2014. 

In 2016 Maria Alyokhina successfully debuted as a lead actress and co-playwritght of critically acclaimed “Burning Doors” – a play of Belarus Free Theatre, a story of three artists, who became political prisoners in Russia:  Maria Alyokhina, Petr Pavlensky and Oleg Sentsov.

Based on 'Heungboga', a pansori masterpiece of Mr. Heungbo has been produced by Goh Seon-wung who has been recognized for original production and great writing. After the first and successful attempt at chaungguk in 2014 with ’Madame ONG’ which was also the first changguk to be presented in France(2016, Theatre de la Ville), Mr. Heungbo is getting tons of attention as his second changguk. Lee Ji-ram who boasts of the capability of adding distinctive flavors to a theatrical piece to create an almost new genre will be responsible for lyrics, composition and musical direction to offer the best he can.Both Lee and Goh agreed that the approaches to pansori, a Korean classical genre featuring infinite imagination need to encompass changes for the taste of modern audience while leaving the core intact. While working on the script, Goh boosted dramatical tension and fun by adding new pieces of story and characters while maintaining the moral lessons of the original. Though the story may appear slightly different, the show will deliver the theme of the original, which is 'What is it like to live as a good person' with improved clarity and effectiveness. He also placed twists where they are the least expected to turn the show into the most extraordinary changguk with twists. Meanwhile, Lee comes up with the music where traditions and modernity co-exist through unlimited variation and by adding new sounds while making sure to stick to the original style of 'Heungboga' as the pansori. He plans to import the 'Nundaemok' part from 'Heungboga' to boost the dignity of the whole music and to boost the musical appeals of the changguk by applying rhythmical modern music to the newly added story. The basic idea of Lee's effort for Mr. Heungbo is to musically expand the drum beats of pansori played by the Gosu(drum player). Like the beats of Gosu supporting the singing in a pansori work, music will help the lyrics and singing by the actors stand out even more. Another noticeable aspect of 'Mr. Heungbo' is advancement of young male actors in their 20s and 30s who have recently been boasting of maturing acting capabilities. Thanks to their fantastic performance, the audience may run into great tension and affection between the brothers.

She has a bit of a mouth on her, but she’s only trying to be funny, give everyone a laugh, not cause trouble, like. Not today, of all days. She loves that little boy more than she ever thought it was possible to love another human. There’s a lot riding on these 24 hours, and if she keeps her head down, she’ll get him back.

Everyone has a story to tell... but... there’s a time and a place. This is neither. Follow Charlie, the queen of self-sabotage as she tries desperately - for once in her life – to keep her mouth shut long enough to make it count.

How is it to question oneself as the self that could be or that could have been? In this intimate performance the performer appropriates the identity of the spectator and uses it. This may trigger irritation, wonder, but also allows for deep reflection on intimacy and the importance of our face/look in our identities.

The spectator has the opportunity to see themselves in various genders and bodies but also to see themselves in a new relationship to themselves and to ask their 'other' self questions. The field of tension results from the partial reversal of the performer-spectator relation, respectively  from this reflective situation in which the mirror image is always a little distorted. Is it not true that one tends to see oneself in the other? And doesn’t this projection also allow for some empathy?

The six scenes of the performance are inspired either by discussions with the audience I had been present to in these last couple of years at home or abroad, or by interviews, and although the similarities with real people are not accidental, the performance doesn’t aim to associate a certain artist with a certain discourse. As part of the system, we were interested in understanding the way that the artists’ (ir)responsibilities shows through their discourse about their own approach and the world they live in.

Mixing live performance and music with film and animation, Golem follows the life of extraordinarily ordinary Robert Robertson, whose life is irrevocably disrupted when he buys a golem – a creature who will improve the efficiency of his daily affairs. But when Robert upgrades to Golem 2.0, the show asks what happens when man is no longer in control of machine. 

Eerily relevant to our tech-obsessed world, Golem is directed and written by Suzanne Andrade, with film, animation and design by Paul Barritt – who jointly won Best Designer at the 2015 Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards for the production. 

Seamlessly synchronizing live music, performance and storytelling with stunning films and animation, Golem is the fourth show from 1927 and had its world premiere at the Salzburg Festival in August 2014. Following a two-month​ sold-out and extended season at the Young Vic, followed by West End transfer it has since toured extensively, visiting Taiwan, France, China, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Australia and the United States. In 2015, Golem won a Critics Circle Award for its design and a Knights of Illumination Award. 

Confirmed 2017 performances will take place at Theatre Royal Plymouth, Bristol Old Vic, #PULSE17 (Ipswich), Oxford Playhouse and Harrogate Theatre, as well as Denmark’s ILT Festival and South Korea’s LG Arts Centre.

The stories are the same, they just appear in different refractions in different periods of time. We are strongly motivated to find the language, the keynote to make these basic stories sound valid.

Our goal is to grasp and hold on to the present: by identifying the problems, we urge to revise them, to offer pivots to solving them.

The story, our story appears to be simple, a little nothing, a perfectly ordinary small matter.

Ilesa Duncan, artistic director of Pegasus Theatre Chicago, directs Evanston native and Northwestern University alumna Lydia R. Diamond’s “juicy family drama” (New York Times) about a family with hidden secrets and the impact of their revelation.
Northwestern’s Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts presents “Stick Fly” May 12 to 21 in the Josephine Louis Theater, 20 Arts Circle Drive on the Evanston campus. 

Director Duncan says she was attracted to the play by the language, characters, rich connection to African-American culture, race relations and family dynamics. “I think audiences will relate to the universal themes of class inequities, infidelity and intergenerational differences. As a director, I’m looking forward to connecting with Northwestern’s talented students and faculty.”

The play features the affluent, African-American LeVay family at a gathering at their Martha’s Vineyard home for the weekend. Brothers Kent and Flip have each brought their girlfriends home to meet the parents for the first time. As the two newcomers butt heads over issues of race and privilege, longstanding family tensions bubble under the surface and reach a boiling point.

When the play premiered on Broadway in December 2011, playwright Diamond told the New York Times she had set out to write a traditional “well-made” play in the style of Lillian Hellman, with deep family secrets being exposed in surprise revelations and plot twists. Diamond also blends themes of race and black American culture into the lively comedy-drama mix.

9N8HrgXaadN6Nzcrm,je ne veux pas marcher seul,"[{'_id': 'MTfKfwxdeSjFvdBP3', 'name': 'Joe Jack et John'}]","je ne veux pas marcher seul puts on stage three performers/characters who confront each other and explore the many different facets of fear. Their quest is woven around the character of Edon, a young man whose story is linked to the tragic life of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager gunned down by a Miami neighborhood watch volunteer in the winter of 2012.

The show explores the theme of fear of the unknown, and develops around the phenomenon that fear becomes an excuse for discrimination and violence. Loosely based on xenophobic acts committed in recent years in the United States and Canada, the play exposes through 10 scenes the broad spectrum of fear: from blatant racism to hidden anxiety, as well as the use of fear as a tool for mass control.

Blending dance, story-telling, hip-hop music and video projections, Joe Jack et John presents a multidisciplinary and post-dramatic work of art. The company also pursues its mandate of atypical casting, through the inclusion of a learning-disabled actor of haitian descent, whose mere presence on stage poses questions related to social norms, diversity and perceptions of otherness.

je ne veux pas marcher seul rassemble sur scène trois performers/personnages qui se confrontent les uns aux autres et explorent différentes facettes de la peur. La quête se tisse autour du personnage d’Edon, un jeune homme dont l’histoire renvoie à celle de Trayvon Martin, un adolescent noir tombé sous les balles d’un vigile de quartier de Miami, à l’hiver 2012.

En explorant le thème de la crainte de l’autre, le spectacle s’intéresse au phénomène selon lequel la peur devient une excuse pour justifier des paroles et des gestes discriminants et violents. Librement inspiré d’actes xénophobes posés au cours des dernières années aux États-Unis et au Canada, la pièce expose en une dizaine de tableaux le vaste spectre de la peur : du racisme flagrant à l’angoisse cachée, en passant par l’usage de la peur comme outil de contrôle des masses.

Intercalant danse, témoignages, rap et projections vidéo, Joe Jack et John propose une oeuvre multidisciplinaire à la forme résolument contemporaine.

May 17 – June 3, 2017 at The Cultch’s York Theatre in Vancouver (Opening May 19th)

And June 7 – 18, 2017 at National Arts Centre in Ottawa 

MORE INFORMATION AND SHOW TIMES: http://urbanink.ca/children-of-god/

An Urban Ink production in collaboration with NAC English Theatre, in association with Raven Theatre and The Cultch.

CHILDREN OF GOD is a gorgeous, powerful musical about an Oji-Cree family whose children were taken away to a residential school in Northern Ontario. The story of Rita, a mother who was never let past the school’s gate, and her kids, Tom and Julia, who never knew she came, pushes toward redemption. CHILDREN OF GOD offers a thrilling blend of ancient traditions and contemporary realities, celebrating resilience and the power of the Indigenous cultural spirit. Inspired by First Nations music, Payette’s profoundly moving score also includes echoes of provocative Broadway masterpieces.

Shocked by the way Canada sweeps aspects of its history under the rug, Oji-Cree theatre maker Corey Payette wrote CHILDREN OF GOD as a way of starting the conversation, acknowledging the hurt done, and acknowledging the strength of the survivors and their descendants. CHILDREN OF GOD is one family’s story, but it represents the stories of hundreds of thousands; it is a beautiful tribute to the strength and resiliency of Indigenous peoples across Canada.

“CHILDREN OF GOD is a generous gift that helped me understand my role in the process of reconciliation as a non-Indigenous Canadian. It’s an inspiring and immediate call to action, and essential viewing for anyone who lives on this land.” 
~ Vancouver performer and playwright, Christine Quintana

“Every once in a while someone as special as Corey Payette comes along with a project as special as this. CHILDREN OF GOD was developed as part of The Collaborations because it was so extraordinary, passionate and beautiful.” 
~ Associate Artistic Director, NAC English Theatre, Sarah Garton Stanley

Even the stage is a Hall of Mirrors and the play-within-a-play, enacted by a troupe of schoolboy actors, is Hamlet itself.

Julian Assange, Bradley—now Chelsea—Manning, Adrian Lamo, Hillary Clinton, David Leigh, a passerby, Wikileaks, the United States, Iraq, a ghost... Famous and unknown people, politicians and whistleblowers, and dominoes falling one after another are at the heart of Étienne Gaudillère's first direction, inspired by the 2010 Cablegate affair and its treatment by the media. From the Iraqi desert, a young American soldier leaked United States diplomatic cables. Via its founder Julian Assange, Wikileaks revealed their existence to the world. And then things got complicated... Thanks to its inventive montage, halfway between surveillance and freedom of speech, Pale Blue Dot plays with multiple forms of expression—MSN conversations, media interviews, eyewitness accounts, even monologues in verse—and questions in a most lively way the blurring of engagements and boundaries. With characters such as the lone wolf Bradley “Chelsea” Manning and the troubling Julian Assange, wars are no longer fought on the battlefield but in the media, and a new world appears: ours.","['Monologue / Solo Performance', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'New Technology', 'New Work', 'Peacebuilding / Conflict Transformation', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['France'],['French']

Audiences will begin the performance sifting through a basement archive of a forgotten revolutionary, navigating histories true and false, real and imagined, before they make their way into the performance space, a safe-house within a house in 1970s Detroit. Imagery unfolds both mundane and shocking; a live-score is performed on analog synthesizers and everyday objects; L’Internationale is sung; an explosion occurs.

Can you capture history in a body or in a movement? This is the question that choreographer Mithkal Alzghair asked himself when making his award-winning diptych Displacement. As Syrian and dancer he already has a lot of history on board: colonisation, conflict, war, violence and migration. With his work, Mithkal seeks a new history and new identity which is both Syrian and European, and that combines modern dance and dance traditions. In the first part of Displacement he investigates the tension between his Syrian roots and forced migration in a solo performance. In the second part he and two other dancers search for the relationship between the individual and the group, and between fleeing and returning.","['Arab Diaspora', 'Dance / Movement / Choreography', 'Refugee', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['France'],

Thebes, which Eteocles defended against his brother's assaults, is ruled by Creon, Jocasta's brother. As soon as the brothers are dead, the tyrant enacts a law to differentiate between the “good” brother and the “bad” one: citizens are strictly forbidden to bury Polynices according to the customary rites. Sophocles, who paid more attention to his characters' psychology than any of the other Greek poets whose work survived Antiquity, tells the story of the Eteocles and Polynices's sister, Antigone, and of her determination to honour both her brothers, as is her duty. Betrothed to Creon's son Haimon, she challenges the injustice of men to obey the laws of the gods and follow her heart, which doesn't distinguish between her kin. She will bury her brother, even if she then has to die. Satoshi Miyagi, with his deep knowledge of tragedy, has decided to further explore the strict distinction the West operates between “the good” and “the bad.” In the Cour d'honneur of the Palais des papes, the symbol of an authority that is wont to create such distinctions, but also a place whose large wall challenges and tames egos, the director has chosen to work on water, fire, and shadows to celebrate the true nature of all the characters with their numerous layers, within a story one might call archaic.",['Translations / Adaptations'],,['Japanese']

A new play by Milta Ortiz
Directed by Marc David Pinate

Based on real people and events *Sanctuary* chronicles the Tucson birth of the 1980’s Sanctuary Movement.

In 1981, when Carol and Mica find out about detained Salvadorans fleeing civil war, they set out to process political asylum applications. After they meet Victor, a Salvadoran in a Border Patrol detention center, they realize they're going to need help. They call on Father Hartford, who is first to meet Nidia, another Salvadoran with strong but different opinions on the Salvadoran civil war.

Carol and Mica enlist pastor Jeff Chord of Southside Presbyterian Church, who sits on the National Presbyterian Council and before long Quaker Will Hewitt joins the group with ideas of his own. As the number of detained Salvadorans and Guatemalans continues to grow, the group must choose whether or not to stand up for what they believe. Will they choose the law of man or the law of God?

*Sanctuary* kicks off a trilogy of plays dealing with immigrants seeking refuge in the U.S., exploring the U.S. involvement in Central America, its consequences, and response.

Sie machen sich auf, ihre eigenen Sexualitäten zurückzuerobern, und begeben sich auf die Suche nach alternativen, queeren, feministischen, ausufernden, abwegigen, fantastischen Bildern für das eigene Begehren.

All across the United States we see these ruins, these wastelands, but with this empty devastation there’s always something else partnered with it; wild beginning to heal what civilization has destroyed.

How and why this rewilding happens, not just in landscapes, but also in humans, is the central story of The Wastelands. We believe these wastelands exist within ourselves as well as in the visible world; the forces behind a profit-driven culture, and its privileging of certain populations over others in a system of extreme control, have done great damage to people, individually and collectively. We believe in the need to evolve and grow beyond a culture that turns the world into commodities, because the inevitable consequence is that we commodify and objectify ourselves.

We believe that a first step in rewilding is beginning to have hope that other ways of life are possible – that we are not trapped in a culture where the value of life is based solely on utility. Our performance is not about proposing a program for how to do this; we are not trying to convince anyone of another system to replace what we have. Instead, we are asking the questions: What else is possible? How does one find hope in despair? What does it mean to rewild oneself and one’s community? What are the wastelands, and how can they transform into the wild, in the world and in ourselves?","['Immersive', 'Multidisciplinary / Interdisciplinary', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['United States'],['English']

This statement, made by Yair Shamir, then Israeli Minister of Agriculture, to the Jerusalem Post in October of 2014, marked the climax of the so-called “Milky protest”. In a post that launched a thousand ships, the Facebook page Olim L’Berlin (Aliyah to Berlin) urged Israelis to move to Berlin due to a markedly cheaper cost of living. The primary evidence? Aldi’s Puddingcreme mit Sahnehaube, a dessert comparable to Milky, the dominant pudding brand in Israel, sold for less than a third of the price. This Facebook post received more than one million likes within four days and created headlines around the globe.

Nearly 75 years after the end of the Second World War, Berlin’s Israeli community is estimated to number in the tens of thousands and impossible to verify due to issues of multiple citizenship. Is Berlin truly this promised land of milk and honey?  Are people from Israel really immigrating here only because of the standard of living, nightlife and Berlin’s fabled cultural reputation? What about those Israelis who leave the country due to the current political climate? And what affects do 20th century history as well as multiple reports of rising antisemitism have on emigration from Israel to Germany?

The trip is set in motion when Mary suddenly takes ill, and Michael, in hope of healing their struggling relationship, suggests that returning to Poland to find their lost histories could help them mend.

His theory is that their disconnect from their country of origin – Poland – is a contributing factor to the disconnect from each other. The plot, however, takes an unexpected turn when Michael and Mary discover a vibrant contemporary world of Jewish revival in Poland. Unbeknownst to them, many Poles in contemporary Poland are looking for lost Jewish identities, and are, in fact, returning to their Jewish roots. At its heart, We Keep Coming Back is an investigation into the impact that histories – both inherited and hidden – have on subsequent generations – and how the unraveling of stereotypes create space for possible futures.

We Keep Coming Back is a complex, soul-baring and often very humorous performance that takes audiences deep into the genuine traumas of the post-war generations using documentary storytelling, archival video and projection design. It is performed by Michael Rubenfeld and Mary Berchard – real-life son and mother – and Katka Reszke.

With an adoption of a gender comes a history. 

One year after his first injection of testosterone, trans man Kit is perceived completely as a man. However, with this triumph comes a crisis of masculinity; what kind of man is he? Drawing on autobiographical experiences, Testosterone is the true story of Kit Redstone’s first entrance into a male gym changing room at the age of 33. What first appears as a routine ritual of four men changing after a workout, then transforms into an epic coming-of-age quest for a masculine identity in an environment that affords little space to hide. 

“Lucid, funny, and moving, Rhum and Clay’s Testosterone ends up reflecting back at us our own world, a world where masculinity is both a loaded concept and a lived experience ” — Exuent Magazine

ZwrRZQQ5Me2xJdxW3,Timon of Athens,"[{'_id': '5877b59317334f313edb4a3e', 'name': 'William Shakespeare'}]","In the beginning, Timon is a wealthy and generous Athenian gentleman. He hosts a large banquet, attended by nearly all the main characters. Timon gives away money wastefully, and everyone wants to please him to get more, except for Apemantus, a churlish philosopher whose cynicism Timon cannot yet appreciate. He accepts art from Poet and Painter, and a jewel from the Jeweller, but by the end of Act 1 he has given that away to another friend. Timon's servant, Lucilius, has been wooing the daughter of an old Athenian. The man is angry, but Timon pays him three talents in exchange for the couple's being allowed to marry, because the happiness of his servant is worth the price. Timon is told that his friend, Ventidius, is in debtors' prison. He sends money to pay Ventidius's debt, and Ventidius is released and joins the banquet. Timon gives a speech on the value of friendship. The guests are entertained by a masque, followed by dancing. As the party winds down, Timon continues to give things away to his friends: his horses, as well as other possessions. The act is divided rather arbitrarily into two scenes, but the experimental and/or unfinished nature of the play is reflected in that it does not naturally break into a five-act structure.

Now Timon has given away all his wealth. Flavius, Timon's steward, is upset by the way Timon has spent his wealth, overextending his munificence by showering patronage on the parasitic writers and artists, and delivering his dubious friends from their financial straits; this he tells Timon when he returns from a hunt. Timon is upset that he has not been told this before, and begins to vent his anger on Flavius, who tells him that he has tried repeatedly in the past without success, and now he is at the end; Timon's land has been sold. Shadowing Timon is another guest at the banquet: the cynical philosopher Apemantus, who terrorises Timon's shallow companions with his caustic raillery. He was the only guest not angling for money or possessions from Timon. Along with a Fool, he attacks Timon's creditors when they show up to make their demands for immediate payment. Timon cannot pay, and sends out his servants to make requests for help from those friends he considers closest.

Timon's servants are turned down, one by one, by Timon's false friends, two giving lengthy monologues as to their anger with them. Elsewhere, one of Alcibiades's junior officers has reached an even further point of rage, killing a man in ""hot blood."" Alcibiades pleads with the Senate for mercy, arguing that a crime of passion should not carry as severe a sentence as premeditated murder. The senators disagree, and, when Alcibiades persists, banish him forever. He vows revenge, with the support of his troops. The act finishes with Timon discussing with his servants the revenge he will carry out at his next banquet.

Timon hosts a smaller party, intended only for those he feels have betrayed him. The serving trays are brought in, but under them the friends find rocks and lukewarm water. Timon sprays them with the water, throws the dishes at them, and flees his home. The loyal Flavius vows to find him.
Timon renounces society (1803 engraving for Shakespeare, Timon of Athens, Act IV, Scene 1)

Cursing the city walls, Timon goes into the wilderness and makes his crude home in a cave, sustaining himself on roots. Here he discovers an underground trove of gold. The knowledge of his discovery spreads. Alcibiades, Apemantus, and three bandits are able to find Timon before Flavius does. Accompanying Alcibiades are two prostitutes, Phrynia and Timandra, who trade barbs with the bitter Timon on the subject of venereal disease. Timon offers most of the gold to the rebel Alcibiades to subsidise his assault on the city, which he now wants to see destroyed, as his experiences have reduced him to misanthropy. He gives the rest to his whores to spread disease, and much of the remainder to Poet and Painter, who arrive soon after, leaving little for the senators who visit him. When Apemantus appears and accuses Timon of copying his pessimistic style there is a mutually misanthropic exchange of invective.",['Classical'],['United Kingdom'],['English']

The Annotated Life of Imogen of Messina, last sighted in the First Folio of William Shakespeare's ""Much Adoe About Nothing""

A feminist hijacking of Shakespeare that investigates the voices that have been absented from our canon, and the consequences of cutting them.

This event has been developed to draw us together to advance the stories of our own industry, careers, companies, successes, ambitions and priorities. The gathering provides us with a safe, collegial space in which TNN members, advisory groups, and all those working across the diverse NSW theatre sector can come together to collectively progress our ideas, needs and values.

The afternoon’s program follows a specifically-devised process that reflects our craft and allows us to practise and refine our actions and priorities culminating in the live and raw presentation of a ’NSW State of Theatre Address’. Further refinement and reporting on the afternoon’s stories, break-out groups, and collective input will be published by Theatre Network NSW for 2019 and will form much of our future programming.

NSW’s theatre industry is the largest of any Australian state or territory. Its diversity is limitless, its power to transform continues to reveal new insights into the hopes, dreams and realities of Australia and its people. Each year thousands of NSW theatre workers consider their place in the world and their industry and make active contributions to them both.

This gathering is an opportunity to share and refine the priorities and initiatives of our sector in a collegial setting and, together, to develop clearer ways to communicate those achievements and aspirations with our leaders and communities.

The afternoon program led by Sydney Festival Director, Wesley Enoch, is open to all NSW theatre workers. It brings together theatre industry advisory groups and initiatives to provide examples, seek feedback, reassess our industry’s priorities, and celebrate with one another.

“THAT’S THE BEAUTY OF CAPITALISM. THERE ARE NO LIMITS.“

VINOVAT,-Ă is a one-woman show which confronts the climate crisis, the greatest threat to social justice today. The play examines the relationship between the ideology of laissez-faire capitalism, consumerist apathy and the suffering of people from the global south.

Climate change is happening. The Pacific island nations are disappearing underwater. Bangladesh is currently a third underwater. Once arable land is baking in the sun, rivers are drying, horrendous civil wars are erupting all over the world. Although Europe is not yet feeling major changes, millions of people from countries which barely have a carbon footprint are fleeing their homes in order to stay alive. VINOVAT,-Ă asks whose responsibility it is to stop the global crisis and reminds that it is not too late to act.","['Climate Change', 'International', 'Monologue / Solo Performance', 'New Work', 'Political / Social Engagement']",['Romania'],"['Romanian', 'English']"

Winner of two Obie Awards and four Tony Awards®, Hedwig tells the story of “internationally ignored song stylist” Hedwig Schmidt, a fourth-wall-smashing East German rock ‘n’ roll goddess who also happens to be the victim of a botched sex-change operation, trying to find a place to belong in America. Join the outrageous and unexpectedly hilarious Hedwig as she shares her story backed by her rock-band “The Angry Inch” for an immersive rock gig, stand-up comedy event that will ultimately inspire anyone who has felt life has given them an inch when they deserve a mile.","['Immersive', 'LGBTQIA*', 'Musical Theatre']",['United States'],['English']

Britain colonised 25% of the Earth’s land surface, subjugated 500 million people and justified the mass violence as a civilising mission. In the UK, migrants, refugees and those seeking asylum are scapegoated, detained without charge, interrogated, forced into destitution, deported without warning, suffocated, beaten and pushed to suicide by the British state’s anti-immigration and anti-asylum policies.

British-Romanian collective BÉZNĂ Theatre present a reading of their latest new play, ILLEGALISED, a journey through the Home Office’s human rights abuses against ‘the other’ that exposes the immigration-industrial complex and the profit made from the illegalisation of human beings.

Inspired and informed by interviews with migrants, refugees and those seeking asylum, ILLEGALISED is the first part of a protest cycle denouncing Britain’s dehumanising of people for power and profit from colonial times to today.

ILLEGALISED is protest-theatre calling for solidarity.

In these texts, it is about making a counter-culture: subversive by nature, submerged by condition. It is about releasing the words suffocated in the books, it is about making the stage jump some truths without underpants. It is, finally, to highlight the historical forgetting a non-institutionalized knowledge, bastard child of the culture in power, generated by bureaucratic circuits of the ideological apparatus.

CROSSROADS
at New York Live Arts
June 20-22, 2019 at 7pm

Amanda Selwyn Dance Theatre presents the World Premiere of Crossroads as part of their 19th Annual Performance Season, running Thursday-Saturday, June 20-22, 2019 at 7pm at New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, New York City. The weekend will also include a champagne reception prior to the Friday performance and a Gala dinner immediately following the Saturday performance. 
Tickets are $30, (performance only), $75 (includes pre-performance reception on Friday, June 21), or $250 (includes post-performance Gala dinner on Saturday, June 22) and can be purchased at https://amandaselwyndance.org/crossroads-world-premiere/.

Crossroads is an evening-length work that explores moments of forging into unchartered waters and the ensuing and often tumultuous process of self-discovery. Inspired by the work of René Magritte and Maurits Escher, Selwyn collaborates with scenic & costume designer Anna-Alisa Belous to shape a surrealistic landscape that highlights these lingering moments at the crossroads, choosing one path or another, and how these moments steer the course of our lives.

""Amanda Selwyn is a master at illustrating the symbiosis of sound and movement, the romance of motion and emotion - she had me laughing, crying, cringing and gasping all in the short 55-minute production."" 
- Inside New York

""Amanda Selwyn's work is masterly and emotionally expressive, she is truly gifted in the art of dance making."" - NYC Dance Stuff

The performance on Saturday, June 22, 2019 will be followed by a Gala dinner hosted by Amanda Selwyn Dance Theatre Board Member Ethan Ganc at his home in Manhattan. The Gala will include a live auction, with spectacular prizes including an all-inclusive Tuscany getaway, a Brooks Brothers suit, a Lafayette shopping spree, and more.

Crossroads features choreography by Amanda Selwyn and dancers, and will be performed by Alex Cottone, Michael Bishop, Manon Hallay, Misaki Hayama, Isaac Kerr, Torrey McAnena, Ashley McQueen, Fabricio Seraphin, and Sarah Starkweather. The creative team also includes Anna-Alisa Belous (Costume and Scenic Design), Joel Wilhelmi (Sound Design) and Devin Fletcher (Stage Manager).

Amanda Selwyn Dance Theatre creates original and dynamic dance theatre that raises questions, challenges social norms and values, and magnifies humanity through dance. Productions pivot around core themes and through an interplay between athletic and pedestrian motion, activate emotional expression, character, and narrative in a rich and abstract collage. Presenting dance in an immediate, mature, and inclusive way, the company engages audiences from start to finish and beckons a response of thought, feeling, and soul. www.amandaselwyndance.org

Founded in 2000, Amanda Selwyn Dance Theatre has presented over 65 productions at NYC venues including Tribeca Performing Arts Center, New York Live Arts, Dance Theatre Workshop, Dance New Amsterdam, Danspace Project, Ailey Citigroup Theater, The Kumble Theater, John Jay College, and Mark Morris Dance Center.

The tale of the two young lovers torn apart by feuding families remains, but the innovation of this production gives audiences an opportunity to experience Shakespeare like never before.

Langs has brought his critically acclaimed direction to fifteen Shakespeare plays in the course of his career. His inspiration for this production comes from the current political and social climate and by the rise of youth-led activism in direct response to events of violence and unrest. “Romeo + Juliet is a play about how old systems fail young people. How an older generation fails a younger one. It is the most passionate love story of all time, and now is the right time for ACT to tell,” Langs asserts. Performed in the round, The Allen Theatre will be completely transformed to surround the audience with the world of the play for a unique and powerful immersive experience.

Featuring Deaf actors Joshua Castille and Howie Seago, this production is American Sign Language (ASL) integrated. Sign Coach Ellie Savidge, local ASL interpreters, Director John Langs, and members of the cast have been working through the text and determining the translation of Shakespeare’s language that will express this beautiful, powerful story to all audiences.  From the deconstruction of the text to the transformation of the theatre space to the integration of ASL, ACT Theatre’s Romeo + Juliet will leave an impact well beyond the final performance.","['Deaf', 'Disability']",['United States'],"['English', 'Sign Language']"

Satan comes to 1930's Moscow, but he's not the devil we think we know-
THE MASTER & MARGARITA: A remix of Bulgakov by theater simple OPENS April 5 - closes April 27, 2019.

theater simple shakes up a philosophical Molotov cocktail with shots of magic realism, vaudeville, the Bible and live music in this original interpretation of Mikhail Bulgakov's final masterpiece. 

In association with Theatre off Jackson, theater simple 'breaks and remakes' their award-winning take on Mikhail Bulgakov's satire for 2019.  Originally staged in 1997, and last seen in Seattle in 2001, the world has changed, and its time to look to see what else has shifted. Recipient of the FRINGE AWARD for BEST PLAY at the 1998 Adelaide Fringe, M&M has been theater simple’s most requested work, and given the state of global politics,  ripe for re-examination. 

Banned then censored for over 30 years, it has become one of the most influential novels of modern Russia.
THE very basic-est BASICS: (imagine nesting dolls - you find a related story in each as you open them) 

1932: The Devil comes to Moscow, demonic entourage in tow, to learn if Stalin's politics have actually changed human nature... And to find a hostess for his annual Devils Ball. These stories are tangled up with an alternate telling of a fateful meeting with Pontius Pilate.

Generated and adapted into a headlong experience from the novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, this 95-minute pellmell rollercoaster features one trunk, 3 screens, a ghostlight and 5 actors, with on-stage musicians playing a brand new score by Brent Arnold. 
Cast: Nathan Brockett, Jennifer Faulkner, Llysa Holland, Monique Kleinhans & Teague M Parker.

“engrossing - This is the kind of apparent simplicity that demonstrates real theatrical sophistication - an invitation for an audience to take a leap of the imagination. A stunning combination of stagecraft and storytelling.” The Edmonton Journal

Originally created in 1997, it toured for 4 years to sell-out engagements at festivals in Canada, across the US and in Australia.

Celebrating theater simple's 29th year of making things, *The Master & Margarita* will be running amok at Theatre off Jackson in the International District.

In Palimpsest, Christianity never became one of the world's most widely practiced religions. Some time ago, however, a great religious war raged across Palimpsest, ceasing only because the manifestation of MAGIC forced humanity to stop fighting or risk total societal collapse-but not all the wounds from that time have been erased. Society is still heavily divided and the illusion of peace covers the constant structural threat of civil unrest. Inspired by video games and animated television, A Game of LIFE uses audience engagement and multimedia to construct an immersive theatrical gaming experience audiences must crowd play in order to advance through the narrative. Can you help Asushunamir, our protagonist, survive Ragnarok, the world's first magical combat tournament? Can you and a bunch of strangers come into a room and work together to help save a world? Or will you all watch as the MAGIC of Palimpsest is erased?

This is a mostly on rails, dialogue-based immersive theatrical gaming experience, crowdplayed by a live audience. Featuring stylized movement and dance, A Game of LIFE requires audiences to give verbal commands and play classic games like ""Duck, Duck, Goose,"" ""Two Truths and a Lie,"" and ""Simon Says"" with an ancient and otherworldly twist. Life is a conversation all of our voices fit into.

She is fascinated with what is known as the “Rare Biosphere,” a term that refers to rare, previously overlooked, microbial species that play a crucial role in regulating Earth’s ecosystems.

The play draws a parallel between our current immigration crisis with the beauty and necessity of diversity in our ecosystem, offering an unique underrepresented perspective into a broken system that many of us only experience through news reports.

To escape the critics, Anna and Betty accepted what they thought would be a temporary job in Amsterdam. Twenty-five years later, the women receive an invitation to return to the states where the infamous piece will open a women’s theatre festival that promises to be ‘angry, raucous, and shamelessly gorgeous.’ Uncertain of what kind of reception she will get after so many years in self-imposed exile, and unmoved by Betty's reassurances, Anna's insecurity only grows when she meets Pete Watson, the ambitious young performer who has been chosen to recreate the role but whose theatrical experience is so far limited to the adult entertainment industry. Searching for common ground, Anna and Pete must confront their ideas about themselves and about each other, as they search for a way to reconcile their two very different ways of looking at the world. This is a story for anyone who has ever tried to build a bridge between generations, hoping to offer a lifetime of advice to some unsuspecting young person (who probably hasn't asked for it,) and discovered in the process that there is as much to learn as there is to teach.

So let me hide my silver-tipped walking stick when I say: By God, SITI Company has got it. In the thrilling, breathlessly rapid *Radio Macbeth*, co-directors Anne Bogart and Darron L.

A dramatic writing lab: the author presents her work in progress on a play commissioned by Analogio for the celebration in 2021 of the 200 years of the Greek Revolution of 1821.

Duration: 45’.

How can one write about «revolution» in the era of ‘meta’? Borders have been surpassed and heroes have been dismantled. We need to have new plays.
In this writing lab, playwright and director Natalie Katsou, along with a team of actors, will begin on stage in order to shape the script through practice. Using language triggers and stage directions she will make use of improvisation and performance techniques to explore the material that will later develop into a play and a show. Audience response will give orientation to the lab, which will be followed by a short Q&A.

O Amor que Habito premiered as Coletiva Teatro’s first devised show in April of 2018 at «Centro Cultural Banco do Brazil», Brazilia.

Excerpts 
Should I continue? Thank you. Repeatedly saying NO to your soul is… And considering the complexity of the soul -which we are only able to express through the boy we live in- fortunately or unfortunately- it seems our individual existence is so trivial, so limited, so we invited other characters to help us tell this story.

Live music with traditional Indonesian musical instruments: Kromong (a collection of small gongs with pentatonic scale), gendang (traditional hand played drum) and tehyan (traditional Betawi string instrument).
Duration: 45 minutes

Nusantara Arts Forum is a cultural group from Indonesia. Most of their performances derive from /or are inspired by traditional customs of the Betawi (the ethnic group of Jakarta).

The plays
Sirih Kuning dance: traditional Betawi dance for the male and female youths to meet each other. The dance reflects their happiness in the meeting.
Priok dance: a new dance inspired by the history of Jakarta. It is related to the origin of the name of Jakarta's largest harbour, «Tanjuk Priok». «Tanjung» means medlar tree, and «priok» is a traditional rice cooker. The dance portrays female teenagers who are entertaining themselves during their break from cooking in the kitchen. The performers will also perform traditional martial arts of ""Silat"" as part of the dance.
Ondel-ondel: is a large puppet figure featured in Betawi folk performance. Ondel-ondel is an icon of Jakarta. Traditionally, the figure of ondel-ondel was known as barongan, a word derived from the «barong»: a protective spirit. After the independence of Indonesia, the function of ondel-ondel shifted from a protective spirit figure to an iconic figure of entertainment. The performance showcases a group of Betawi people in celebration with the ondel-ondel. The original ondel-ondel puppet is around 2.5 metres tall. The performance will only have a smaller version of ondel-ondel.
Piring Cupak dance: traditional Minangkabau ethnic group dance from West Sumatra. The performers dance in a dynamic paced movement with dining plates.
Legenda Buaya Putih: a short dramatic dance performance about the legend of a white crocodile that can be found in several regions in Indonesia.
Angklung - Interactive performance: The angklung is a traditional Sundanese musical instrument, from West Java, made of a varying number of bamboo tubes attached to a bamboo frame. The tubes are carved to have a high resonance when struck and are tuned in octaves. Each instrument has one tone.

The play
Throughout time - through drawings in caves, storytelling, books or movie screens and smartphones - humanity recognizes, teaches, inspires, ponders and is transformed by the stories it creates and tells. Under the moonlight, in a playful and cozy mood outdoors, «Moonlight Tales» brings together moments of entertainment and reflection through the art of storytelling with a unique combination of traditional folk tales suitable for an adult audience. The evening’s programme includes «The Fisherman» and «Not Even God is Ripe Enough to Catch a Woman in Love».

Excerpts
One day I was at my workshop, working on a very difficult necklace… and an aroma, a perfume so powerful, so luscious, crept under the door. The door swung open and there stood three veiled women. They entered in a single step and spoke in unison from behind their veils:
«Goldsmith, are you happy?»
«What kind of a question is that?» I said. «Of course I am happy. I’m a happy man. And please, do not hesitate to call me if you need anything. Goodnight.» 
And from behind their veils they laughed: «Well, if you ‘re happy…»
And with a swift turn they left, closing the door and leaving the aroma and the question behind.

The play
The KASSANDRA HECUBA project is a multimedia play structured in two monologues, based on the tragedy The Trojan Women by Euripides. Kassandra Hecuba features two of the most significant mythical characters of Greek tragedies in building an image of ""Chaos"", as figures of various voices interact in the sphere of a visual poem of our time. In search of the synthesis, each figure represents the many voices of refugees who, in an attempt to change the course of their lives, leave for a journey into the unknown. The female voice of the dethroned queen, Hecuba, reveals in her corner of lament, the pain of the human being in its extreme situation. The discredited predictions by Kassandra are like oracles of our history that reveal the contemporary era of media, the widespread crisis and the everyday chaos.",[],['Brazil'],[]

Three (3) sessions per day conducted by Matthias Gehrt, Yagil Eliraz, Giorgos Zamboulakis, with the collaboration of the International Playwrights’ Forum(IPF)/UNESCO, under the mentoring of its president, Professor Gad Kaynar-Kissinger.

The Translation Tryout Workshop «Relocating Antigone», that takes place, in the context of ANALOGIO Festival 2019 with the support of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens is dedicated to the question: What influence does the translation of a play - in view of the recognition that translation constitutes a cultural, and not merely lingual transference - exert on its conception and performance in a strange context, either foreign or local but periodically remote? This question is especially pertinent when related to the translation of ancient Greek Tragedy since older translations that retain the poetic wealth and depth of the original version might be so academic, heavy and non-theatrical to a degree that makes them unperformable to modern spectators, while free contemporary translations might be more playable, and seem more attractive to younger spectators at the expense of losing the layers of the rich, structured language, as well as the myriad of interpretations and multi-layered reception history of the work. Greek and visiting directors will attempt to explore- through the text-case of a scene from Antigone by Sophocles - the impact of translation on theatre in process.

The play
Mrs. X is a monologue in 15 scenes. The main character is the homonymous Mrs. Being exposed are all the issues of her life without cover-up, embellishments and circumventions. We see a vulnerable and upright woman who falls and rises every time, carrying the whole earth on her shoulders.

Excerpts
This is what “going back” means and much more than that. It is something about recalling and realizing through time… Thus, when the snow fell from the mountains to the valleys, I was determined to give them shape. Quiet. Peaceful. In any case, these tender cotton wools are silent by nature. They absorb any sound discordance.  This is because the gods stop fighting in the sky. Its shape had something like soft curves to prevent the caress from stumbling. 
When the mirror reassured me that there was a relationship of mutual appreciation, I casually shook off the snow and stepped out as a bareheaded girl, ready for departure.

The play
Going against age-old customs and traditions, a young woman named Tesa will, for the first time, take part in one of the fishing expeditions that have been helping the people of a small and isolated island to survive for hundreds of years. Using a lantern, a small group will trick a boat to crash on the rocks. The rule is that each fisherman marks one object on the wreck with his pebble, and this object becomes his. Tesa, the leader's daughter, has marked a semi-unconscious sailor who now belongs to her. Love, envy, the fear of difference, and above all, the distance between two unbridgeable worlds lead the story to a tragic end despite the tender, poetic and compassionate efforts of Margie, an eerie and curious character.

Tessa : (presque surprise) - Mon caillou. Je l’ai posé. Tu n’as pas le droit de le toucher.

The play
Between two labor shifts, in the yard of a hardware factory, some female students gather for a memorial to a fellow student who committed suicide. The play begins when her mother enters the scene. Everyone is dressed in black.
Highly charged, while the students weep like the chorus in ancient Greek tragedy, the mother narrates her story, her fate. She speaks the words of her beloved daughter that she could not understand until she committed suicide. In this turmoil, in this orgy of souls, the dead daughter appears with the Underworld’s troupe: old women with disheveled hair, beggars, bodies of dead babies in paper boxes, cripples, kids with ball bearings…
They sing their own stories, and they lament until the factory’s siren announces the next shift. Our lives are derived in shifts, entry and exit cards from here to Bangladesh, to New York…

Excerpts
DAUGHTER
As months go by
as time goes by
I can see in the dark
Like the bats
in the same temperature I forever live
under the ground
in the same heat of time.
Those who reach the dark
with the light still in the eyes
those who seek to see us
will never see us
will never touch us
for they ignore who we are
what happened to us
what occurred to us
and we vanished into the darkness.

The play
In a utopian place, high on a mountain, there is a resort, a hostel for theatrical characters. They are born from the playwright and they are at the disposal of any director, in any theatrical scene of the world. Once these idols have been sculpted and have appeared on stage, they retire to the boarding house. Nevertheless, in those lodgings, something unique happens: the non-existent creates real life. 
The proprietor of the boarding house is Flora, a woman of indefinite age and temperament, who makes us wonder who sculpted her. At some point Eda arrives, a very proud and assertive woman, whom Flora pairs with Blanche, as, at the boarding house, everyone has a roommate. Very soon, intense conflicts arise between Eda and Blanche, as the playwrights of these two women have endowed them with completely different personality traits. Eda and Blanche come from different periods and with different pursuits and mentalities, even though there is a subtle thread that knits them. 
When Eda decides to make a reckless move, the tectonic plates of invention, the substance of the theatrical characters inside Flora’s non-existent boarding house, will soon get a different and dramatic dimension.

The play 
A girl runs through the olive groves. The dry, red dust swirls up in the archaic landscape and falls down on a schoolyard in the 1970s. She runs from rulers and commanders. She runs from male teachers and police officers.
The story about the girl is ancient and constant – a fear is planted in a girl’s body to take root and then grow. It becomes one with the experience of her own body.
In Antigone’s trail we meet the ruler and the rape culture that he enforces. We’re confronted with the eagerness of power to conceal its insecurity, and the violence it inevitably generates.
The play is composed of a number of voices, without names or definite characters.
The voices insist, defend and avoid, and together they form an image of both themselves and of the timeless Antigone girl.

The play
Just as every afternoon, a grandson types the memoirs of his grandfather. After many months, the day arrives when they are about to finish. The old man seeks for vindication. The grandson, however, is sarcastic. He doubts and constantly challenges the words his grandfather. A loving relationship, with tenderness, irritation, patience, and tension form the background to an ending life. There comes the time that the grandson has to go to the hospital to see his moribund mother, but his grandfather won’t let him. He keeps him close, so that they can both finish his memoirs. Through the written record of a cruel past, they detect the anger in the present, the memories, the burden that History carries, the side-effects, and the traces that others’ choices can cause, the persistence and the spiritual liberation. They meet inside loss and they organize the forthcoming “departure”, the farewell table and the clothes for the long journey… 
Through all these difficult times, there is always a grandfather inside us, who can see things in their true dimensions and put them together again. 

Excerpts
GRANDSON: Shall I read it?
GRANDFATHER: Yes, I think it is better for us to listen to it, to see if it flows smoothly…
GRANDSON: Yes, you and your smoothness… I found it: “I remember the churches’ bells ringing, from three villages. They were ringing as a sign for all the men to go and strike their chests in front of the armed tsar police, to protect their children. Those police officers who were riding horses were hitting us fiercely, with rage and they wounded many people. They used swords, weapons, whips. Near the summer huts, a little further from the border outpost. Most of the soldiers watched this brutal attack on those poor farmers.”

by Ursula Werdenberg (Switzerland)
Translation: Smaro Kotsia
Director: Chryssanti Corneliou

Based on a novel by Linda Stibler

Actors: Giannis Lambropoulos, Haris Symeonidou, Nikos Chaldeakis, Eleni Tziaka, Tasos Antoniou, Giannis Kostaras

The play
This is an old story, based on proof from court protocols of 1827 found in the city archives of Basile in Switzerland. A love story between a young (poor) woman and a young (rich) man from the countryside. She gets pregnant, the young man is afraid to marry her, because his father has forbidden it. He wants him to marry into another rich family. If he doesn’t obey, he will chase him away and disinherit him. The pressure on the young man is too much, so he decides to leave the young woman. She sues the young man demanding to marry her and to acknowledge the baby; unfortunately, he denies both of them. The church and the court in older times used an awful method for such cases: They interrogated the young woman during the labour to the child. They asked her constantly whom she made love with. They were interested to find out who the father was. The only aim of the interrogation was to ensure that the local community would not have to pay for the child.

Excerpts
JUDGE: You said that you left with the others. Now you`re saying that you stayed behind for a quarter of an hour. Which one was it exactly?
HEINRICH: When Anna`s brother came into the room, I chatted with him and then I left.
JUDGE: So, you were never alone with Anna Weibel?
HEINRICH: No, her brother was there. If it was my child, I would never have lef things go so far, I would`ve taken her as my wife.
ANNA: It is your child.
JUDGE: Miss Weibel, Heinrich Müller maintains he did not have relations with you.
ANNA: Certainly he had relations with me. Of course he did. He even assured me that if anything happened, he`d stand by me, and he wanted to give me a marriage promise. But he didn`t give me anything.
HEINRICH: At the Liestaler Fair you didn`t go home alone, but went with Johannes Kestenholz and Josef Socin.
JUDGE: What do you say to that, Miss Weibel.
ANNA: It’ s a lie. At the Liestaler Fair I went home with my brother. It`s your child, Heinrich.
JUDGE: It seems to me the matter is still not clarified. The statements contradict each other. We will adjourn the trial and continue the questioning on our next day in court, which is in a week on the 15th of January 1827.

Excerpts
There are many strange and wonderful things,
but nothing more strangely wonderful than man.
He moves across the white-capped ocean seas 
blasted by winter storms, carving his way
under the surging waves engulfing him.
With his teams of horses he wears down
the unwearied and immortal earth,
the oldest of the gods, harassing her,
as year by year his ploughs move back and forth. 
He snares the light-winged flocks of birds,
herds of wild beasts, creatures from deep seas,
trapped in the fine mesh of his hunting nets.
O resourceful man, whose skill can overcome 
ferocious beasts roaming mountain heights. 
He curbs the rough-haired horses with his bit
and tames the inexhaustible mountain bulls,
setting their savage necks beneath his yoke.
He’s taught himself speech and wind-swift thought,
trained his feelings for communal civic life,
learning to escape the icy shafts of frost,
volleys of pelting rain in winter storms,
the harsh life lived under the open sky.

The project is supported by the European Union’s Creative Europe programme and is led by the Greek theatre company LabIllusions, with partners from Italy (Teatro dei Venti), Poland (Teatr Biuro Podrozy) and Romania (Fusion of Arts).

-The Kaspar Machine play
The central product of the project is the “Kaspar Machine” play, designed to be shown in an outdoor public space, such as old deserted industrial buildings, quarries, harbour piers, refugee camps or rugged landscapes. The play exploits Peter Handke’s text “Cries for Help” as well as excerpts from his plays “Kaspar” and “Offending the Audience”, intercepted by real stories of individuals experiencing social exclusion, gathered through field research. The play is staged in a multi-media performance, including members of excluded communities alongside professional actors, to share their frustrations with the wider community, build hope and test the principles of participatory theatre. The “Kaspar Machine” play is scheduled to be shown in two performances in Athens on 19 and 20 September 2020 and subsequently in Modena, Italy and Poznan, Poland.

The performance is supported by Hellenic Ministry of Culture.","['Contemporary', 'Deaf', 'Disability', 'Documentary', 'Experimental', 'Improvisation', 'New Technology', 'Performance Art', 'Physical Theatre', 'Political / Social Engagement', 'Refugee', 'Site-specific', 'Street Performance/Outdoor Theatre']",['Greece'],"['Greek', 'Italian', 'Polish', 'Romanian', 'English']"
